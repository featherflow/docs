⚙️ What Is Source Scheduling?

**Source Scheduling** is a native feature in Bitscale that allows you to automate data collection from external sources at your chosen frequency. It's especially powerful when you're using sources like:

- **Google Maps** (for location-based lead gen)
- **LinkedIn Search**
- **Job Boards**
- **Webhooks**

Instead of clicking “Fetch” every time, you define a schedule—Bitscale handles the rest in the background.

### 🔄 How It Works

1. **Import Data Using a Source Tool**\
   For example: use the **Google Maps** tool to search for "gyms in Australia".
2. **Create a Grid with Results**\
   Bitscale automatically generates a grid with results. You can use these entries directly or feed them into enrichment workflows.
3. **Open “Data Sources” Panel**\
   Inside your grid, click the **“Data Sources”** button (top-left). You’ll see the tool you used to import the data, e.g., Google Maps.
4. **Configure a Schedule**
   - Set how frequently you want data to refresh: every 30 mins, hourly, daily, etc.
   - Choose the start time for the first fetch.
   - Click **“Save Schedule”** to activate it.

   Once saved, Bitscale will automatically fetch new rows at the defined interval and insert them into your grid—ready for any downstream enrichment, scoring, or export automation.

### 🧠 Why It’s Powerful

- **Fully automated source → enrichment → outreach workflows**
- Removes manual work from your lead generation loop
- Perfect for always-on campaigns that depend on live data
- Enables advanced triggers like “new job posted” or “new branch opened” to power outbound campaigns in real time

### 🛠 Managing Your Schedules

You can:

- Edit your schedule anytime (change frequency, time)
- Pause or delete it if you're experimenting
- Chain it with enrichments or even sync to tools like Outplay, HubSpot, or Heyreach using downstream integrations

If you’re building lists using live data sources or running always-on lead enrichment, **Source Scheduling** ensures you never miss an opportunity.
