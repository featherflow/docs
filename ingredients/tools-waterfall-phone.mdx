## **Simplify Phone Number Retrieval**

Identifying accurate phone numbers for outreach is crucial but can often require querying multiple data providers. Bitscaleâ€™s **phone waterfall action** automates this process by:

* Sequentially parsing through multiple phone data providers in a user-defined order.

* Returning the first valid phone number retrieved, saving time and resources.

* Eliminating redundancy by ensuring only unique and verified numbers are captured.

This feature is designed to reduce manual effort while improving the accuracy of your lead data.

**1. Define Your Provider Sequence**

Set up your workflow by selecting the phone data providers you want to query. Bitscale allows you to:

* Add multiple providers in a prioritized sequence (e.g., Provider A â†’ Provider B â†’ Provider C).

* Customize the order based on reliability, speed, or cost preferences.

**Why This Matters:** Tailoring the provider sequence ensures optimal results based on your unique needs.

**2. Retrieve Phone Numbers**

Once your provider sequence is defined, the waterfall action:

* Queries each provider in the specified order.

* Stops as soon as it retrieves a valid phone number.

**Why This Matters:** This reduces processing time and ensures youâ€™re always working with the best available data.

**3. Minimize Redundancy**

To prevent unreachable phone numbers in your grid, Bitscaleâ€™s waterfall action:

* Allows you to set up validation on each fetch attempt.
