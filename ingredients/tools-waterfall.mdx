### **Overview**

One of Bitscaleâ€™s core strengths is its ability to **parse from multiple providers** to achieve wide coverage of contact information. With our **Email Waterfall** and **Phone Waterfall** enrichments, you can maximize coverage across providers while keeping costs low.

1. This workflow allows you to:
   - Import lead lists (CSV or Excel) or generate them natively on Bitscale
   - Run email and phone number enrichments with multiple providers
   - Validate results to reduce bounce rates
   - Export or push enriched data into your CRM or outreach tools

   ---

   ### **Step 1: Import Leads**

   There are two ways to bring your lead data into Bitscale:
   - **From CSV/Excel**: Go to the _New Grid_ section and upload your file.
   - **From Bitscale Tools**: Use the **Find People** enrichment to generate leads directly on-platform.

   For best results, include common identifiers such as:
   - Full Name
   - Title
   - LinkedIn URL
   - Company Name or Company Website

   ---

   ### **Step 2: Running the Email Waterfall**
   1. In your grid, open the **Enrichments Panel â†’ People â†’ Email Waterfall**.
   2. Pass input parameters:
      - **Required**: Full Name \+ Company or Full Name \+ Company URL
      - **Optional**: Personal LinkedIn URL (improves coverage)
   3. Configure providers:
      - Enable or disable specific providers
      - Reorder them by drag-and-drop (e.g., place most accurate first)
   4. (Optional) Enable **Validation**:
      - Choose a validation provider for external verification
      - Recommended for high-intent lists to reduce bounce rates to \<0.5%

   #### **How it Works**
   - Bitscale queries providers sequentially.
   - You are only charged for the provider that returns a valid result.
     - Example: If Leadmagic and Nimbler fail but Prospio returns an email, only Prospio credits are deducted.

   > ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: If your niche responds well to just 2â€“3 providers, disable the rest to save time and credits.

   ### **Step 3: Adding Emails to Your Grid**
   - After the enrichment runs, click **Add to Column** to insert results directly into your grid.
   - Coverage typically ranges from **90â€“95%**, though 100% is sometimes possible.

   ### **Step 4: Running the Phone Waterfall**
   1. Go to **Enrichments Panel â†’ People â†’ Phone Waterfall**.
   2. Pass the **LinkedIn URL** (required). Other fields are auto-mapped.
   3. Configure providers and validation just like the email waterfall.
   4. Run the enrichment and add results as a new column.

   ### **Step 5: Keeping Grids Clean**
   - Hide or disable waterfall columns from the **Columns Tab** if you only want final results visible.
   - This keeps exported lists tidy and focused.

   ---

   ### **Step 6: Exporting or Pushing Data**
   - Export enriched grids as **CSV/Excel**.
   - Or, push them directly to outreach platforms or CRMs via Bitscaleâ€™s **Integrations**.

   ---

   ### **Best Practices**
   - Always include **Company Name/URL** and **Full Name** for maximum accuracy.
   - Add **LinkedIn URL** when possible to improve match rates.
   - Use validation for **curated, high-intent lists** where deliverability is critical.
   - Disable low-yield providers to save credits on niche campaigns.
