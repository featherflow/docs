### **1. Setting Up the Action**

To get started, add an action column and navigate to **Tools â†’ Web Search** to find the Google Web Search tool. The interface is simple yet powerful, featuring:

* **Keyword Section**: Simulate how your query would appear in a Google search bar.

* **Prompt Section**: Add instructions to refine your search or direct the tool to focus on specific outputs.

**Example Setup:**
Letâ€™s say youâ€™re searching for a LinkedIn profile:

1. In the **Keyword Section**, input something like:
   `"Arun account executive at Google site:linkedin.com"`

   * This query restricts the results to LinkedIn domains and focuses on a specific person and role.

2. In the **Prompt Section**, provide additional directions, such as:

   * **Retrieve LinkedIn profile URLs** only.

   * Ensure the result matches the specific person and domain.

***

### **2. Running the Workflow**

Once set up, the tool parses through Googleâ€™s web search results to find the exact information you need. For example:

* Retrieving **LinkedIn profile URLs** for a list of names and companies.

* Refining searches for **contact details**, publications, or other specific outputs.

**Why This Matters:**
The combination of Google-like search simulation and tailored prompts eliminates irrelevant results, saving time and ensuring accuracy.

***

### **3. Using the Results**

The results, such as retrieved URLs or other targeted data, can then be:

* **Enriched further** using Bitscaleâ€™s other tools for email retrieval, qualification, or intent signals.

* **Integrated directly** into your workflows for outreach, research, or analysis.

For instance, LinkedIn URLs retrieved through this tool can be directly pumped into follow-up workflows to fetch verified contact details or analyze prospect profiles.
