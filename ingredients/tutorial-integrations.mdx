Bitscale connects seamlessly with your favorite tools for **data enrichment, outbound automation, CRM syncs, and alert workflows**. Integrations can be set up in one of three ways:

1. **Bridge-Based Integrations** ‚Äì For CRMs and complex tools like HubSpot or Salesforce.
2. **API Key Integrations** ‚Äì For outbound tools and enrichment platforms like Instantly or Smartlead.
3. **Webhook Integrations** ‚Äì For incoming alerts or data pushes from other software into Bitscale.

---

### **1. Bridge-Based Integrations**

Bridge-based integrations handle authentication automatically.

**Examples:**

- HubSpot
- Salesforce
- Slack

**Steps:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the sidebar.
2. Click on the integration (e.g., HubSpot).
3. Follow the bridge authentication process ‚Äî a new window will open asking for permissions.
4. Once connected, the integration appears as ‚ÄúActive‚Äù in your account.

> üí° No need to copy or paste API keys ‚Äî everything is authorized through the bridge.

---

### **2. API Key Integrations**

Most outbound and data tools connect via API keys.

**Examples:**

- Instantly
- Smartlead
- Lemlist
- Heyreach

**Steps:**

1. Go to **Integrations ‚Üí Add Integration**.
2. Select the platform (e.g., Instantly).
3. Enter:
   - **Integration Name** (for your reference).
   - **API Key** from your account on that platform.
4. Save and test the connection.

**Where to Find API Keys:**

- Usually under _Settings ‚Üí Integrations_ on the respective tool.
- Copy and paste the API key into Bitscale.

> üí° You can reuse the same API key for multiple grids or workflows if your plan allows.

---

### **3. Webhook Integrations (Incoming Data)**

For inbound data ‚Äî such as alerts or lead pushes ‚Äî use **Webhooks**.

**Use Case:**\
If another platform (e.g., Zapier, CRM, or form tool) sends data to Bitscale, you can set up a webhook endpoint to receive it.

**Steps:**

1. Go to **New Grid ‚Üí Import Data ‚Üí Webhook**.
2. Copy the unique **Webhook URL** generated.
3. Paste it into the source platform that sends the data.
4. When the source sends an alert or payload, Bitscale automatically populates your grid in real time.

> üí° Webhooks are ideal for connecting alert systems, CRMs, or automation tools that send JSON data.

### **Custom API Integrations**

For advanced users, Bitscale supports **custom HTTP API calls** to connect with unsupported platforms.

Check the **Custom API Integration** documentation for step-by-step instructions on creating POST/GET requests, passing headers, and automating actions.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use **Bridge Integrations** for secure CRM connections.
- Use **API Keys** for outbound or enrichment tools.
- Use **Webhooks** for inbound alerts or automated data pushes.
- Maintain separate integration names for multiple accounts (e.g., ‚ÄúSales Team HubSpot‚Äù vs ‚ÄúMarketing HubSpot‚Äù).
- Verify each integration with a test run before using it in workflows.

---

### **Summary**

Bitscale integrations allow you to connect to CRMs, outreach platforms, and external systems through **three flexible methods** ‚Äî Bridge, API Key, and Webhook. Whether you‚Äôre syncing data, pushing leads, or automating alerts, integrations ensure a smooth, end-to-end data flow between Bitscale and your sales stack.
