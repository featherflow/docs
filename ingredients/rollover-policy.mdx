title: "New Platform Credit Rollover Policy"
---

### Overview

Bitscale provides flexibility in credit management through its **Rollover Policy** â€” ensuring you donâ€™t lose unused platform credits at the end of your billing cycle.\
This feature helps teams handle uneven monthly usage, especially when campaign volume fluctuates or enrichment activity peaks in certain weeks.

---

### **How Rollover Works**

At the end of each billing cycle, **unused platform credits automatically carry over** to the next month.

- You can **accumulate up to 3x your monthly credit limit** as a rollover balance.
- Once this threshold is reached, any additional unused credits will **expire** at the end of the month.

> ðŸ’¡ This rollover system ensures you always have enough credits available for heavy outbound or enrichment periods while preventing indefinite hoarding.
