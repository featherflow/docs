Once you have built your perfect account list, accounts that match your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and are ready for outreach, the next step is to identify the right people within those companies.

**Find People from Company** is a native enrichment available inside Bitscale that allows you to quickly map accounts to relevant contacts based on job titles, departments, seniority, and more.

You can access this enrichment from:

- **Enrichments Panel** ‚Üí **People** section (top-right of your grid)
- **Company** section
- Or by searching ‚ÄúFind People from Company‚Äù in the enrichment search bar

---

### **Using Find People from Company**

When you open the enrichment, you‚Äôll see a tile interface where you can define your **persona** and **search parameters**.

#### **Mapping to Account Data**

- Map the enrichment to the **Company Website** (or other relevant account-level identifier) from your account grid.
- Define your **target persona**:
  - Specific job titles (e.g., ‚ÄúProduct Manager‚Äù)
  - OR combinations of **Departments** and **Seniorities** (e.g., ‚ÄúProduct Management‚Äù \+ ‚ÄúManager and above‚Äù)
- Optional filters:
  - **Location**
  - **Time in Current Company**
  - **Total Experience**

> üí° Filters like _Time in Company_ and _Total Experience_ are unique to Bitscale and may not be available in competitor tools.

---

### **Running the Enrichment**

1. Set your filters (e.g., Product Management \+ Manager/Director/VP).
2. Save and run the enrichment.
3. Contacts matching your criteria will be populated in the selected column.

---

### **Exporting Contacts to a New Grid**

Your account-level data will typically have all contacts stored within a single cell per company. To act on them individually, you‚Äôll need to **explode** these contacts across rows:

1. Open any populated contact cell.
2. Click **Export Leads**.
3. In the **Export to Grid** action:
   - **Destination Grid**: Select _Create New Grid_
   - Map any additional account-level columns you want to include with each contact (e.g., Company Revenue).
4. Run the export.

A new grid will be created within the **same workbook** as your account-level grid, containing all your enriched contacts.

---

### **Referencing Account-Level Data in Contact Grids**

- In the contact grid, use the **Source** button to pull in any account-level fields you mapped during export (e.g., Revenue).
- The value will be replicated for all contacts from that company, enabling context-rich personalization.

---

### **Next Steps**

Once your contact grid is ready, you can:

- Run additional enrichments (Find Emails, Find Phone Numbers, Get Titles, etc.)
- Set up outbound campaigns directly from the enriched contacts
- Build **email waterfalls** or **phone waterfalls** to maximize reach

---

### **Reusing the Setup**

After the initial setup:

- You **don‚Äôt** need to reconfigure enrichments or exports for new accounts.
- Simply select a new account row in the account grid and run the process, contacts will flow into the contact grid with all mapped columns populated automatically.

This workflow is a ‚Äúbread-and-butter‚Äù use case in Bitscale, perfect for consistently converting high-quality account lists into enriched, campaign-ready contact lists.
