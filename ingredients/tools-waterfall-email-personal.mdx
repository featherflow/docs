### **1. Setting Up the Personal Email Waterfall**

Retrieving personal email addresses with the waterfall tool is simple and efficient:

#### **Steps to Configure the Tool**

1. **Go to Tools**:

   * Open your grid and click **Add Column**, then navigate to **Tools**.

   * Select **People – Personal Email Waterfall**.

2. **Input Parameter**:

   * The only required input is the **LinkedIn URL** of the prospect.

   * This URL is used to find the personal email address associated with that contact.

3. **Active Providers and Validation**:

   * You can customize the providers used by the waterfall to enhance accuracy.

   * If you only want validated emails (safe to send), enable the validation layer in the tool settings.
