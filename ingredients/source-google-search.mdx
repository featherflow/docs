### How It Works

1. **Start a new grid** and select **Google Search** as the source.
2. Use standard search syntax like:
   - `site:linkedin.com/in cyber security`
   - `site:angel.co fintech India`
   - `intitle:"job" AND "hiring" site:startup.jobs`
3. **Set your result limit** (up to 100 per query).
4. **Preview and import** the search results directly into a new or existing grid.

You’ll get fields like:

- **Title** (the clickable blue link text)
- **Snippet** (the context preview from Google)
- **Page** (the raw HTML link title)
- **Link** (the final URL)

Perfect base data for enrichment.

### Bonus: Schedule Your Search

Once your grid is live, click the **Data Sources** button. From there, you can schedule your search to auto-refresh daily, hourly, or at custom intervals.

Use it to:

- Monitor hiring activity
- Track mentions of companies or competitors
- Watch for new web pages with specific keywords

### Power Tip

You can also add existing sources to any grid at any point. Just go to **Data Sources → Other → Google Search**, and plug in a new query anytime.
