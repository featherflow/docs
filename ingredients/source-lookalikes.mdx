Company Lookalikes help you find **similar companies** to those that already use or benefit from your product. This intent-based source is powerful for:

- Expanding your ICP by targeting similar accounts
- Leveraging **competitor signals** in outreach (e.g., “X company uses us, and you may benefit too”)
- Building **new lists quickly** without starting from scratch

Bitscale provides two approaches:

- **Lookalikes as a Source** (manual setup, starting point for new lists)
- **Lookalikes as an Enrichment** (inside a grid, automated workflows)

This guide covers Lookalikes as a **Source**.

---

### **When to Use**

- You’ve identified companies where your platform delivers strong value and want to find similar accounts.
- You want to **leverage competitor adoption** as an outbound trigger.
- You’re expanding into new markets or industries while staying aligned to your ICP.

---

### **Setting Up Company Lookalikes**

1. Go to **New Grid → Find Company Lookalikes**.
2. Provide the **Company URL** (required).
   - Example: `scrut.io`
3. Apply optional filters:
   - **Location** (e.g., United States)
   - **Keywords**: Add bias toward specific domains if a company spans multiple categories.
   - **Industry**: Narrow down to avoid irrelevant verticals.
   - **Employee Size Range** (multi-select).
   - **Number of Results**: e.g., 100.
4. Import results into a new grid.

**Credit Model:** 1 credit per company retrieved.

### **Data Captured**

For each lookalike, you’ll receive:

- Company Name
- LinkedIn URL
- Industry
- Headcount Range
- Overview / Description

By default, an **Enrich Company** column is preloaded (usually via ContactOut). You can replace this with **LinkedIn Enrichment** for higher accuracy.

---

### **Next Steps: Building a Workflow**

1. **Enrich Company Data**: Pull LinkedIn descriptions, headcount, funding, and other live attributes.
2. **Find People from Company**:
   - Prioritize by size/role: Head of Sales, Head of Marketing.
   - Fallback to VP/C-suite if no department heads found.
   - Fallback again to champions (SDRs, BDRs).
3. **Export to Contact-Level Grid**: Explode contacts into rows.
4. **Email & Phone Waterfalls**: Enrich for direct contact info.
5. **Copy Generation**: Use value props and competitor mentions as personalized openers.
6. **Outreach**: Push to Instantly, Lemlist, Heyreach, or your CRM.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use **employee size ranges** to target companies in your product’s sweet spot.
- Layer lookalikes with other signals (e.g., hiring SDRs, tech stack filters) for precision.
- Personalize messaging with competitor references when appropriate.
- Replace default provider enrichment with **LinkedIn enrichment** for accuracy if credits allow.
- Use **AI-generated value props** to scale personalized messaging.

### **Summary**

Company Lookalikes are one of the fastest ways to expand your ICP. By starting from companies where your solution already works and finding similar accounts, you can generate targeted lists, enrich them with decision-makers, and launch personalized outreach campaigns at scale.
