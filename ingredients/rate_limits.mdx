title: "Custom API Rate Limits"
description: "At Bitscale, we understand that API rate limits vary across platforms, and managing these limits is crucial for seamless integration and efficient workflows. To help you handle rate limiting effectively, we’ve introduced flexible features that allow you to customize how you interact with different APIs, whether using native integrations or custom API endpoints."

### **How It Works**

Whether you’re using **native integrations** or setting up **custom APIs**, you can now define your own rate limits. This ensures that your API calls stay within the allowed thresholds, preventing service disruptions and optimizing performance for your specific use case.

### **Setting Up Rate Limits for Native Integrations**

1. **Access Integrations**:\
   Go to the **Integrations** section on **Bitscale**, and select the integration you’re working with (e.g., **Read Magic**).
2. **Set Your API Key**:\
   Enter your **API key** for the service you're integrating with, as usual.
3. **Adjust the Rate Limit**:\
   Once the integration is set up, you’ll have an option to **set the rate limit** for that particular service. Simply refer to the API documentation of your integration provider to find out what the **allowed number of requests** per time period is, and replicate that in Bitscale.
4. **Done\!**\
   The system will now automatically optimize the rate limits based on your integration’s parameters, ensuring that your calls are made within the allocated limits.

### **Setting Up Rate Limits for Custom API Integrations**

When you’re setting up a **custom API endpoint**—for example, integrating with **Zero Bounce**—the process is slightly different but equally simple:

1. **Choose Your Grid**:\
   Select the **grid** where you’re configuring your custom API integration.
2. **Navigate to the Tweak Section**:\
   In the **Tweak Section** of your grid, you’ll find the **rate limit option**.
3. **Set the Request Limit**:\
   For each custom API call, specify:
   - **Request Limit**: The number of requests you’re allowed to send in a given period.
   - **Duration**: The time period over which the requests are allowed (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
4. **Save and Go**:\
   Once you input the **rate limit settings**, Bitscale will ensure that all calls to the custom API stay within those parameters.
