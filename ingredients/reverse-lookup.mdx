Reverse lookup is one of the most valuable use cases for **product-led growth** and **inbound-heavy teams**.

Most product companies:

- Ask only for an **email** at signup
- Want to keep onboarding friction low
- Enrich the user **after** signup to understand who they are

Bitscale enables this by letting you reverse-enrich a user starting from just an email address.

## When to Use Reverse Lookup

This workflow is commonly used by:

- Product-led SaaS companies
- Freemium tools
- Trial-based platforms
- Inbound motion teams
- Growth and lifecycle teams

Typical goals:

- Identify the user’s role and seniority
- Understand their company and ICP fit
- Personalize onboarding or sales follow-ups
- Route leads to the right workflow or team

---

## Supported Inputs

Bitscale supports reverse lookup from:

- **Work emails** (most common in B2B)
- **Personal emails** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

You can route emails automatically based on domain type.

---

## Step 1: Start with an Email Column

Create or ingest a grid that contains an **inbound email** column.

This can come from:

- Signup events (via webhook)
- CSV imports
- Product analytics tools
- CRM syncs

---

## Step 2: Route Work vs Personal Emails (Recommended)

Before running enrichment, add simple conditions:

- If email **does not contain**:
  - `gmail`
  - `outlook`
  - `yahoo`
  - other personal ESPs\
    → Treat as **work email**
- Else → Treat as **personal email**

This improves match accuracy and avoids wasted credits.

## Step 3: Find LinkedIn Profile from Email

Bitscale provides two dedicated enrichments:

- **Find LinkedIn via Work Email**
- **Find LinkedIn via Personal Email**

### Why LinkedIn is the key output

Once you have a LinkedIn URL:

- Most people-level enrichments unlock
- Accuracy increases significantly
- Downstream workflows become reliable

Map the inbound email to the correct enrichment and run it.

---

## Step 4: Enrich the Person Using LinkedIn

After retrieving the LinkedIn URL:

1. Add it as a column
2. Run **Enrich Person**
3. Bitscale scrapes and structures:
   - Name
   - Current role
   - Company
   - Seniority
   - Skills
   - Experience
   - Summary

This gives you a full profile from a single email.

---

## Step 5: Expand the Workflow (Optional)

Once the person is enriched, you can:

- Find **phone numbers**
- Enrich the **company**
- Run **Bit Agent** to infer:
  - ICP fit
  - Use case
  - Industry relevance
- Push data to:
  - CRM
  - Sales tools
  - Lifecycle automation
  - Slack alerts

All from a single email input.

## Common Product Use Cases

- Lead scoring at signup
- Sales-assisted onboarding
- Trial-to-paid routing
- Account-based personalization
- Founder / decision-maker detection
- Enterprise signal detection from inbound signups

---

## Best Practices

- Always aim to resolve a **LinkedIn URL first**
- Use conditional routing for personal vs work emails
- Treat reverse lookup as the **entry point**, not the final step
- Layer company enrichment and AI classification for best results
