Lemlist is a **multi-channel outreach platform** that supports touchpoints across LinkedIn, email, and more. Since many Bitscale users rely on Lemlist for outbound campaigns, we provide a **native integration** to streamline lead enrichment and campaign execution.

This integration allows you to:

- **Add or update leads** in Lemlist campaigns directly from Bitscale
- **Look up leads** in Lemlist to avoid duplication or retrieve specific profiles

---

### **Available Actions**

1. **Add or Update Leads**
   - Push enriched, filtered, or qualified leads from Bitscale into Lemlist campaigns.
   - Map campaign variables (e.g., name, company, personalization).
   - Control duplicate handling with a simple toggle.
2. **Lookup Leads**
   - Query Lemlist for a specific lead by email or ID.
   - Useful for avoiding duplicate outreach or building dashboards with synced leads.

### **Setting Up the Integration**

1. In Bitscale, go to **Enrichments → Integrations → Lemlist**.
2. Select either **Add/Update Lead** or **Lookup Lead**.
3. Click **Add Account** → Enter a name for the account (e.g., _Marketing Account_).
4. Retrieve your **API Key** from Lemlist:
   - Go to _Lemlist → Settings → Integrations_.
   - Generate and copy your API key (it will only be shown once).
5. Paste the API key in Bitscale and save.

Your Lemlist account is now connected.

### **Pushing Leads to Lemlist**

1. Select your connected Lemlist account.
2. Choose the target **campaign**.
3. Set the action: **Add or Update Leads**.
4. Map required fields:
   - **Email** (primary unique identifier in Lemlist)
   - Additional fields such as **First Name**, **Company**, or custom variables
5. Optionally:
   - Enable/disable duplicates
   - Map personalization variables to Lemlist’s custom fields

---

### **Looking Up Leads**

1. Select the **Lookup Lead** action.
2. Provide an email (or Lemlist ID).

### **Best Practices**

- Always map **Email** as the unique identifier when pushing leads.
- Use **Lookup Lead** before large pushes to avoid duplicates.
- Maintain personalization variables in your Bitscale grid and map them into Lemlist for contextual messaging.
- Keep API keys stored securely, as they are only shown once during creation.
