### **Key Features of the Enrichment Workflow**

1. **Find the Company Website**
   - **Template Used**: **Google Company Website Link**
   - **How it Works**: Simply input the company name, and **Bitscale** will pull the official **website URL**. This is a great starting point for further enrichment.
   - **How to Use**: Go to **Add Column**, select the **Google Company Website Link** template, map the company name, and run it to get the website.
2. **Retrieve the Company’s LinkedIn URL**
   - **Template Used**: **Company LinkedIn URL for Company Name**
   - **How it Works**: With just the company name (or domain), **Bitscale** will find the company’s **LinkedIn profile URL**. This is useful for understanding the company’s presence and connecting with the right people.
   - **How to Use**: Add another column, use the **LinkedIn URL template**, map the company name (or domain), and run the workflow. You’ll get the LinkedIn URL ready for further outreach.
3. **Identify Decision Makers**
   - **Template Used**: **Find Contacts from Company**
   - **How it Works**: Now that you have the company’s basic information, it’s time to dig deeper and identify key decision-makers. This template pulls contact data for specific roles, like **CEO**, **Founder**, **VP**, etc., from the company’s LinkedIn profile.
   - **How to Use**: Add a column, select **Find Contacts from Company**, map the retrieved website to the **Find Decision Makers** column, choose roles (e.g., Founder, CEO, VP), and run it. You'll get the **decision-makers** at the company.
4. **Create a Separate Table for Contacts**
   - **Template Used**: **Create New Table**
   - **How it Works**: After retrieving the decision-maker data, you can export these contacts into a **new table** for better organization. This allows you to visualize and manage your contacts more effectively.
   - **How to Use**: Once the decision-makers are found, you can create a **new table** to hold the contacts, making it easy to track and manage your outreach efforts.
