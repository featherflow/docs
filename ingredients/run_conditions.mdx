## Overview

In complex workflows, you often need to **bifurcate or segment flows** based on the output of enrichments or classifications. For example:

- Separate accounts into **ICP vs. non-ICP** and apply different actions
- Run specific research steps only for a subset of classified accounts
- Exclude certain rows from automated enrichments

Bitscale provides **Run Conditions** for almost every enrichment or transformation, allowing you to automate these branching decisions without manual filtering.

---

### **Using Run Conditions**

1. Select the enrichment or transformation you want to conditionally run.
2. Open the **Tweak Panel → Run Condition**.
3. Define conditions using either:
   - **Building Blocks**: Predefined logical filters
   - **Custom Formulas**: For advanced, multi-column logic

---

### **Building Blocks**

Building blocks are simple logical conditions applied to a chosen column.

- **Condition Types**:
  - Greater than / Less than (for numeric values)
  - Equal to / Not equal to
  - Contains / Does not contain (for strings)
- **Combinations**:
  - **OR**: Enrichment runs if _any_ condition is met
  - **AND**: Enrichment runs only if _all_ conditions are met

Example:

- Column: _Classification_
- Condition: _Contains “ICP”_
- Action: Run enrichment only on ICP accounts

---

### **Custom Formulas**

For more complex scenarios:

- Use **nested AND/OR combinations**
- Reference multiple columns at once
- Write custom run logic manually

**Options:**

- Enter formulas directly in the **Manual Entry** section
- Or generate formulas automatically using **AI Formula Generation** (similar to Formula Columns)

---

### **Workflow Applications**

- Maintain one grid with multiple enrichments, each tied to its own run condition.
- Split accounts into different grids (e.g., ICP vs. non-ICP) and run targeted enrichments in each.
- Automate branching workflows without manual filtering or exporting.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use **Building Blocks** for simple bifurcations.
- Use **Custom Formulas** for multi-column or nested conditions.
- Always test run conditions on sample rows before applying at scale.
- Combine with **Export to Grid** for clean separation of branches.
