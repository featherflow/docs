title: 'List Building - Finding Contact'
description: 'Now that we have identified the companies we want to target, its time to get personal! This playbook walks you through exporting personal leads from the company list, finding their email addresses and phone numbers, and verifying the contact details.'

This is where your company data turns into actionable leads. We’ll start by using the company domains you found to export personal leads (like decision-makers or department heads). After that, we’ll track down their emails using the "Find Email" tool, grab their phone numbers with the "Find Phone" tool, and verify the email addresses to ensure everything is good to go.

## Tools used:

1. Find People: Use this tool to export personal leads (based on the domain of the companies).

2. Find Email: Finds email addresses for the leads you’ve identified.
   Find Phone: Finds phone numbers for those leads.

3. Verify Email: Verifies the email addresses to make sure they’re valid.

4. Flow of Data: Company domain → Find People tool → personal leads → Find Email tool → email addresses → Find Phone tool → phone numbers → Verify Email tool → verified contact info.

Next step: You’re all done! Now that you have the verified contact info, you can use this data for your outreach efforts.

## Pro tip:

Before exporting your leads, double-check the domains to ensure you’re getting the most relevant contacts. Also, always verify emails before using them in campaigns to avoid any issues with deliverability.
