## 5) Writing prompts on Bitscale

Simple prompt structure, objective, stepwise directions, then context, and use the Output Formatter instead of inline formatting. Bit Prompter for first drafts.

## 6) Run conditions

Gate enrichments so only the right rows run. Use building blocks, contains, equals, greater than, and, or, or a custom formula when branching gets complex.
