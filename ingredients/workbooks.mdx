title: "Workbooks on Bitscale"
description: "A workbook in Bitscale is a collection of two or more interconnected grids—just like how you manage multiple tabs (sheets) in Google Sheets. It's designed to help you manage linked datasets in a more organized and modular fashion."

### 📘 When Are Workbooks Created?

Workbooks are automatically created when you use tools like **“Write to Grid”**, which push data from one grid to another. Instead of having disconnected grids floating separately, Bitscale groups them under one workbook to give you a unified view of related data.

### 🔄 Use Case: Writing Contact Arrays to a New Grid

Let’s say you’ve enriched a list of companies to find executive profiles using “Find Contacts from Company.” The result for each row is an array of multiple profiles.

Rather than trying to manage those arrays in a single cell, you can:

1. Use the **Write to Grid** tool.
2. Choose to create a **new grid**.
3. Select the relevant columns (e.g., name, role, company).
4. Run the action — Bitscale will write each contact as a **separate row** in the new grid.

This makes it much easier to run individual enrichments (like email, phone, LinkedIn, etc.) on each profile.

### 🔗 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- When you create a new grid via **Write to Grid**, Bitscale automatically links the two grids.
- These linked grids now live inside a **single workbook**.
- Any time you open either grid, you’ll see the other, and you can easily navigate between them.

This improves data traceability and reduces clutter—especially when you're working across multiple enrichment stages.

### Why Use Workbooks?

- Keep **related datasets together** (e.g., companies and their contacts).
- Simplify large-scale enrichment workflows.
- Improve **visibility and manageability** when chaining multiple tools together.
