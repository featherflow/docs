### **1. Setting Up the HubSpot Integration**

Before importing leads or contacts, you need to connect your HubSpot account to Bitscale. The process is quick and straightforward:

- Go to the **HubSpot Integration Page** in Bitscale.
- Click on **Add Integration**.
- Sign in to your HubSpot account via the same browser.

> **Tip**: Ensure you’re logged into the correct HubSpot account to avoid linking the wrong data.

Once the integration is complete, you’re ready to start importing data.

### **2. Importing Data into Bitscale**

After connecting HubSpot, you can filter and import leads or contacts directly into Bitscale grids.

#### **Steps to Import Data**

1. Navigate to the **Create Grid** section in Bitscale.
2. Choose the type of data to import:
   - **Companies**: For organization-specific details.
   - **Contacts**: For individual lead information.
3. Apply specific filters to refine your imports. For example:
   - **Filter**: Companies where the "About Us" field is empty.
4. Preview the results to verify the filter settings.
5. Import the filtered data into a **New Grid** or an **Existing Grid**.

> **Example**: For this walkthrough, four dummy companies with empty "About Us" fields were filtered and imported into a grid for further enrichment.
