This guide covers a few core Bitscale concepts that you’ll use in almost every workflow:

- Adding multiple data sources to a grid
- Fetching more rows from an existing source
- Creating and using workbooks
- Scheduling data sources
- Adding rows to blank grids

If you understand these well, most Bitscale workflows will feel intuitive.

## Accessing a Grid

From the Bitscale home screen, you can either:

- Create a **new grid**, or
- Open an **existing grid**

Both actions bring you to the same grid interface, an Excel-like workspace where data flows from left to right through enrichments, transformations, and outputs.

---

## Adding Multiple Data Sources to the Same Grid

A single grid can ingest data from **multiple sources**, as long as the same downstream logic applies to all rows.

### When to use this

- You want to process multiple lists with identical enrichment logic
- You are combining people or company lists from different sources
- You want a unified output without duplicating workflows

### How it works

1. Inside a grid, go to **Data Sources** (top-left)
2. Select a source such as:
   - Find Companies
   - Find People
   - Import CSV
3. Configure filters and preview results
4. Click **Add to current grid**

The new rows are appended to the existing grid and automatically flow through all configured steps.

---

## Fetching More Rows from an Existing Source

Most sources return only an initial batch (usually 100 rows) by default. This allows you to test workflows before scaling.

### To fetch more rows

1. Open **Data Sources**
2. Click on the source you previously used
3. Choose how many rows to fetch (up to 1,000 per batch)
4. Click **Fetch rows**

You can repeat this until:

- You exhaust the available results, or
- You reach your search credit limit

There is no hard limit on total rows, only batch size.

## Creating a Workbook (Multiple Grids Together)

A **workbook** is simply a collection of grids grouped together.

### Why use workbooks

- Keep related grids organized
- Pass data between grids
- Separate account-level and contact-level processing
- Maintain clean workspaces for complex workflows

### Two ways to create a workbook

#### 1. Exporting data to a new grid

When you export rows (for example, contacts found from companies) and choose **Create new grid**, Bitscale automatically creates a workbook.

#### 2. Importing a source into a new grid

1. Open **Data Sources**
2. Configure any source
3. Click **Import to new grid**

This creates a new grid inside the same workbook.

You’ll see multiple grids listed at the bottom-left of the interface.

---

## Scheduling Data Sources

Some sources can be scheduled to run automatically.

### Common use cases

- Daily ingestion of new people or companies
- Ongoing intent monitoring
- Evergreen outbound pipelines

### How to schedule a source

1. Open **Data Sources**
2. Select the source you want to schedule
3. Enable scheduling
4. Set frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)
5. Save

To fully automate processing:

- Enable **Auto-run grid**
- Enable **Auto-run enrichments**

New rows will be fetched and processed automatically.

## Working with Blank Grids

You can also start with a **blank grid** if:

- You want to manually input data
- You are receiving data via webhook
- You plan to populate rows later via exports or integrations

Once rows are added, the grid behaves exactly like any other grid and supports all enrichments, formulas, and outputs.
