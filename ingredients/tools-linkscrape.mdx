## **Overview**

Bitscale‚Äôs **Link Scraper** is a powerful tool that enables you to extract targeted information from websites and analyze metadata for deeper insights. This video showcases two key capabilities:

1. Scraping and analyzing **website text** to identify relevant details.

2. Accessing and interpreting **website metadata** to extract additional insights, such as third-party tools or chatbot services being used.

## **Demonstration Use Case**

To illustrate the tool‚Äôs functionality, we set up a workflow for a **B2B support chatbot company** focused on two goals:

1. **Classify prospects** as B2B or B2C companies.

2. Identify whether a prospect has a **chatbot on their website** and, if so, extract the name of the chatbot service.

## **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **1. Scraping Website Text for Classification**

Using Link Scraper, we:

* Provided the **URL column** for a list of five prospects.

* Wrote a prompt to classify each prospect into one of four categories based on their website content (e.g., B2B or B2C).

**Result:** The first column returned the classification for each prospect (e.g., ‚ÄúB2C‚Äù for one and ‚ÄúB2B‚Äù for others).

***

### **2. Analyzing Metadata for Chatbot Identification**

Next, we leveraged Link Scraper‚Äôs ability to parse website metadata to:

* Check if a chatbot service is present.

* Extract the name of the chatbot service (if available).

We achieved this by:

* Adding a specific instruction in the prompt to analyze metadata for chatbot-related information.

* Setting a **fallback value** to handle cases where no chatbot data was found (e.g., displaying ‚ÄúNone‚Äù for such rows).

**Result:** The second column returned the chatbot name for applicable prospects (e.g., ‚ÄúLime Chat‚Äù) or ‚ÄúNone‚Äù where no chatbot was detected.

***

## **Running the Workflow**

After setting up the prompts, we ran the tool across all rows simultaneously. The results:

* Prospects classified as B2B or B2C in the first column.

* Chatbot details extracted in the second column, or ‚ÄúNone‚Äù where no chatbot was detected.

For this use case, good leads for selling a B2B support chatbot were those prospects classified as **B2B** with no existing chatbot or where we could offer a better solution than their current provider.

## **Key Features Demonstrated**

1. **Text-Based Scraping:** Extract relevant content directly from website text to classify prospects or gather other insights.

2. **Metadata Analysis:** Analyze website metadata to identify third-party services, such as chatbot providers or trackers.

3. **Customizable Prompts:** Use tailored prompts to direct Link Scraper‚Äôs focus for specific data needs.

4. **Efficient Workflow:** Process multiple rows simultaneously, saving time and effort.
