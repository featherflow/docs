Most GTM, RevOps, and DevOps teams live inside **Slack**.

Switching tools just to check signals or enrichment results slows teams down and breaks momentum. To solve this, Bitscale offers a **native Slack integration** that lets you push alerts, insights, and enriched data directly into Slack channels where your team already works.

---

## What You Can Do with Slack Integration

With the Slack integration, you can:

- Send **real-time alerts** from any grid
- Push **enriched lead or account signals** to Slack
- Notify teams about:
  - High-intent inbound leads
  - New ICP accounts
  - Hiring or intent signals
  - Reverse lookup results
- Share structured insights without leaving Slack

This keeps execution fast and collaboration seamless.

## Step 1: Connect Slack to Bitscale

1. Go to **Integrations**
2. Click **Connect Integration**
3. Select **Slack**
4. Click **Connect Slack**
5. You’ll be redirected to Slack’s authorization screen
6. An admin from your Slack workspace approves the request

Once approved, the integration is active.

---

## Step 2: Choose a Grid or Signal to Push

After Slack is connected:

1. Open any grid you’re working on
2. Go to **Enrichment → Integrations**
3. Select **Slack – Send to Channel**

This action can be added anywhere in your workflow.

## Step 3: Configure the Slack Message

### Select basics

- Choose the connected Slack account
- Select the **Slack channel** to send messages to

---

### Option 1: Send a simple message

If you just want to send a single value:

- Map a column directly into the message field\
  Examples:
- Inbound email
- Company name
- Alert text generated via formula or AI

---

### Option 2: Send structured messages (Recommended)

For richer alerts, use **custom fields**.

You can define key–value pairs such as:

- Email
- LinkedIn URL
- Company
- Job title
- Intent signal
- Any enriched data point

Each field maps to a column in your grid.

Slack will receive a clean, readable message with multiple data points included.

---

## Example Use Cases

- Notify sales when a **high-intent lead signs up**
- Alert GTM teams when a **target account shows buying signals**
- Push **reverse lookup results** from inbound emails
- Share **LinkedIn profiles** of new prospects instantly
- Send alerts when workflows flag **ICP-qualified accounts**

---

## Best Practices

- Use Slack alerts for **signals, not raw data**
- Keep messages concise and actionable
- Use structured fields for multi-point insights
- Pair Slack alerts with **run conditions** to avoid noise
