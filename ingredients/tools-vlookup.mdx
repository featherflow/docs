description: "In this walkthrough, we explored how to match data across two different grids, such as importing a list of leads and matching it with an internal employee directory to fetch enriched information like titles, company URLs, and LinkedIn profiles."

Bitscale’s VLOOKUP is available in the **Data Toolkit** section under **Enrichments**. Here's what you can do with it:

1. **Select Your Matching Column**\
   Start with the source column in your current grid (e.g., `LinkedIn URL`).
2. **Choose the Target Grid**\
   This could be another imported CSV, an internal grid, or any dataset already present in your workbook.
3. **Define Match Logic**\
   Choose between:
   - **Exact**: Case-sensitive, character-by-character match.
   - **Contains**: More flexible; works even if there are extra characters or case differences.
4. **Pick Fields to Fetch**\
   Once the match is successful, choose what values to pull from the target grid—e.g., name, title, company URL, LinkedIn profile.
5. **Run for Selected Rows**\
   Test it on a few rows first (e.g., top 10) to validate the matches. You’ll see the matched results in JSON view, showing only the selected fields.
