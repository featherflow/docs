## What You Can Do with Bit Agent

**1. Ask Any Question, Get Structured Output**\
Bit Agent navigates a company’s website—including multiple internal pages—and extracts answers based on your prompt. For example, you can ask:

- “What industry is this company in?”
- “Describe its core product in one sentence.”
- “What pricing plans are listed?”
- “Is there any mention of SOC2 or GDPR compliance?”

Just map the input column (typically the website), define the prompt, and specify the output format—Bit Agent will return a clean JSON with your answers.

**2. Control What You Fetch**\
From the tweak section, you can:

- Choose the LLM (GPT-4.1, Claude, or Bitscale Mini for faster runs).
- Select specific fields like `industry`, `description`, `product_features`, etc.
- Set up a reusable action by saving it as a template.

**3. Scrape Metadata for Tech Stack or Embeds**\
Need to know what chatbot, analytics tool, or payment processor a site is using? Bit Agent supports `metadata=true` in your prompt to fetch insights from the raw HTML and page metadata.

**4. Works at Any Scale**\
Whether you're researching 2 companies or 2,000, Bit Agent runs reliably across your entire grid. Set your prompt once and run it across rows, with results appended as new columns for easier filtering and follow-ups.

### Example Use Case in Action

Let’s say you want to learn what a company does and the industry it operates in:

1. Add a new Bit Agent column to your grid.
2. Use a prompt like:\
   `"Visit the landing page. Determine the company’s product and industry. Output industry and description as text."`
3. Choose your preferred model.
4. Run across rows.
5. Map the returned values into new columns like `industry` and `description`.

You’ll now have structured company-level insights you can use for segmentation, prospecting, or analysis.
