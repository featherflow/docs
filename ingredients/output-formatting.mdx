When building automated workflows, **structure matters**.

Any response you generate, especially from AI models, needs to follow a predictable format so it can be:

- Referenced by later steps
- Used in conditions or classifications
- Pushed reliably to CRMs, grids, or integrations

AI models are powerful, but by default they can:

- Change response formats
- Add extra text
- Reorder information
- Hallucinate structure even with strict prompts

To solve this, Bitscale provides **Output Formatting**, a built-in way to enforce structured AI responses across all AI enrichments.

## Why Output Formatting Is Important

Without structured outputs:

- Workflows break unpredictably
- Downstream enrichments fail
- CRM pushes become unreliable
- Automation becomes fragile

With output formatting:

- Every run produces the same schema
- Columns are always consistent
- AI results can safely drive logic and actions

---

## Where Output Formatting Is Available

Output formatting is available on:

- **Bit Agent**
- **GPT / Claude / AI enrichments**
- **Any text-based AI step**

You’ll find it under **Set Output Format** in the enrichment configuration.

---

## Fields vs Lists

Bitscale supports two output types:

### Fields

- Used for **single values** or **comma-separated values**
- Best for:
  - Industry
  - ICP classification
  - Boolean flags
  - Short summaries

**Example:**

```
Industry: SaaS, DevTools
Target Demography: Mid-market B2B
```

---

### Lists

- Used for **multiple structured entries**
- Each item is treated as a separate entity
- Best for:
  - Event attendees
  - Customers
  - Technologies
  - People lists
  - Anything you may want to explode into rows later

**Example:**

```
Customer 1: Name, Company
Customer 2: Name, Company
```

If you plan to export or explode results into another grid, always use **Lists**.

---

## Manually Defining Output Formats

You can manually define:

- Field name
- Data type (text, boolean, number, etc.)
- Output structure

This gives maximum control but requires clarity on what the model should return.

---

## Using “Generate with AI” (Recommended)

For most users, the easiest and safest approach is **Use AI**.

### How it works

- Bitscale reads your prompt
- Understands the intent
- Automatically generates the correct output schema

### Example

Prompt:

> Go through @company_website and find their target demography and customers

Click **Use AI**, and Bitscale generates:

- Target Demography
- Industry
- Customers

All correctly typed and structured.

This dramatically reduces prompt engineering effort and prevents format drift.

---

## Running and Storing Structured Outputs

Once the enrichment runs:

1. The AI response is forced into the defined structure
2. Each output field becomes a reusable column
3. These columns can now be:
   - Referenced in later prompts
   - Used in run conditions
   - Exported to CRMs
   - Passed to other grids or integrations

No matter how many times the enrichment runs, the structure remains consistent.

---

## Best Practices

- Always use output formatting for **AI-driven workflows**
- Use **Fields** unless you explicitly need row-level expansion
- Prefer **Use AI** unless you have very strict schema requirements
- Treat structured outputs as **foundational workflow primitives**
