When you log into Bitscale, you land on the homepage with **My Grids** at center.

### My Grids

This is where all your **grids** and **workbooks** are listed.

- A **grid** is a single workflow where each row is an entity and each column is a step.
- A **workbook** is a multi-step workflow made up of multiple grids

### Quick ways to get started

On the homepage, you will also see:

- latest documentation links
- a product demo to help you set up your first grid quickly

## Manage grids

### 1. Favorite a grid

If you want quick access to a grid:\
Click the **star** icon on a grid and access it from **Starred grids** tab

### 2. Search grids and workbooks

Use the search bar on the homepage to find any grid or workbook by name.

## Get help and support

From the bottom-left section of the app, you can:

- get support
- book a call with the team
- open the product walkthrough
- join the Slack community

You can also open the full documentation anytime from the left sidebar.

## Integrations

You can manage integrations from the **Integrations** tab.

Use this when you want to:

- connect a new tool
- set up a new integration
- use your own API key (BYOK)

Steps:

1. Open **Integrations**
2. Click **Connect integration**
3. Choose the tool you want

If a tool is not listed, you can:

- request it in the community
- set up a custom API call

## Playbooks

Bitscale also has **Playbooks**, which are ready-to-go workflows you can directly use.

These are available only for enterprise customers.

## Workspaces and team access

### Join a workspace

If your team uses the org/workspace setup:

1. Open the workspace menu
2. Click **Join workspace**
3. Search and request access (or join directly, if available)

### Invite teammates

To invite others into your workspace:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Open **Team settings**
3. Invite members

## Create a new grid

Most work in Bitscale starts with creating a grid.

1. Click **New grid**
2. Choose a data source

Common options include:

- import your own CSV or Excel
- create a blank grid
- import company-level data or people-level data
- LinkedIn intent-based sources
- other sources like HubSpot lists, Salesforce reports, tables, and more

## Inside a grid

When you open a grid, you will see:
- a **top panel** for building and controlling workflows
- the main grid in center
- a **bottom panel** for automation, workflow extension, and support


### Columns are workflow steps

Grids look like spreadsheets on purpose.

- each column is a step in your workflow
- **you build workflows by adding steps as columns**

## 1. Top panel (build and control workflows)

### Load data

The **Load data** button (top-left) is where you manage your data sources.

You can:

- attach multiple data sources to the same grid
- schedule or automate those data sources

### Grid Controls

### Sort

Use **Sort by** to reorder your grid based on any column.

### Filter

Use filters when you only want to work with specific rows. \
Example: export or reach out only to people from a certain geography.

### Hide or show columns

As workflows get more complex, you might create intermediate columns that exist only to power later steps. \
You can hide those columns to keep your grid clean and focused.


### Enrichments

Any step that pulls data, researches, scrapes, or generates output is called an **enrichment**.

Enrichments are how work actually gets done in Bitscale - they fetch data research, generate outputs, or move data between tools.

You can find all enrichments under the **Enrichments** tab.

They are grouped into categories like:

- people enrichments
- company enrichments
- email enrichments
- phone enrichments
- research and web research
- AI enrichments (custom or template-based)
- integration and data movement steps (push/pull between tools)


### Exporting and pushing data

If you set up integrations in your workflow, you can push enriched data to:

- CRMs
- outbound tools
- other connected destinations

If you just want a file export:

1. Go to **Actions**
2. Export as **CSV** or **Excel**

## 2. Bottom panel (automation and workflow actions)

### Convert a grid into a workbook

If you want to extend a grid into a multi-grid workflow:

1. Click the **plus** button
2. Pick the data source for the next grid
3. Bitscale creates the next grid in the workbook

### Auto run and auto dedup

Inside the grid, you will also see options like:

- **Auto run** to automate workflow runs
- **Auto dedup** to reduce duplicate entries
