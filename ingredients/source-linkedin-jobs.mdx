### Overview

Hiring activity is a strong **intent signal** that can help qualify accounts and reveal buying intent. If a company is hiring for roles that your product either replaces or complements, it often indicates an opportunity for engagement.

Bitscale provides a **native intent-based data source** to identify companies hiring for specific roles. This source can:

- Serve as a **feeder** for your outbound workflows
- Integrate into existing campaigns or power net-new prospecting flows
- Help SDRs and AEs prioritize accounts showing growth and budget signals

---

### **When to Use**

- **Champion Roles**: Hiring ICs who will use or advocate for your product.
- **Decision Maker Roles**: Hiring executives who may bring change and buy new tools.
- **Complementary Roles**: Roles that align with your product’s value (e.g., hiring SDRs if you sell sales enablement software).

---

### **How It Works**

1. Go to **New Grid → Intent-Based Sources → Find Jobs Data**.
2. Enter a **Job Query** (e.g., “Sales,” “GTM Engineer,” “Data Scientist”).
3. Apply optional filters:
   - **Location**
   - **Experience Level**
   - **Job Type**
4. Import results into a **new grid**.
   - Companies are fetched in **batches of 25 rows**.
   - Use **Fetch More Rows** to expand until the available data is exhausted.

---

### **Data Captured**

For each hiring signal, you’ll see:

- **Company LinkedIn URL**
- **Job Title**
- **Job Description**
- **Location**
- **Job URL**
- **Posting Date**

---

### **Next Steps**

Once companies are identified:

1. Use the **Find People from Company** enrichment (preset in this workflow) to locate relevant contacts.
2. Enrich contacts with **emails and phone numbers** via waterfalls.
3. Reference the **hiring role** in your outbound messaging for personalization.

**Example:**

> “Saw you’re hiring for a GTM Engineer — many of our customers invest in automation tools at the same stage to speed up onboarding and execution.”

---

### **Best Practices**

- For **decision maker signals**, validate against LinkedIn job changes for context.
- Use **champion-level hires** (e.g., analysts, managers) for bottom-up outreach strategies.
- Always tie the **hiring role** back to your product’s value proposition in messaging.
- Layer hiring signals with **company filters** (industry, headcount, funding) for precision.

### **Summary**

Hiring signals are a **powerful intent-based source** in Bitscale. By targeting companies hiring for specific roles, you can uncover high-potential accounts, prioritize outreach, and create contextual campaigns that align with the company’s current growth stage.
