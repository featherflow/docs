Bitscale provides a **native intent-based data source** that allows you to capture signals directly from LinkedIn posts. Unlike other platforms that only provide counts of likes or comments, Bitscale enables you to **scrape full interaction data**, including:

- Profiles of reactors and commenters
- Headlines and LinkedIn URLs
- Reaction type and comment text

This makes it possible to identify highly engaged prospects who already show awareness of your product, competitors, or relevant use cases—perfect for intent-driven outreach.

### **When to Use**

- **Capture competitor mentions**: Identify prospects engaging with competitor posts.
- **Warm up awareness leads**: Target users who already know about your product or category.
- **Segment campaigns**: Build flows based on whether a user commented or simply reacted.

### **Setting Up LinkedIn Post Scraping**

1. Copy the URL of a LinkedIn post.
2. In Bitscale, go to **New Grid → Data Source → LinkedIn Post Data**.
3. Paste the LinkedIn post URL.
4. Choose interaction type:
   - **Commenters** (for deeper intent signals)
   - **Reactors** (for broader engagement lists)
   - Or select both.
5. Define limits (up to 1,000 comments and 1,000 reactions).
6. Import results into a new grid.

### **Data Captured**

Each profile imported will include:

- Full Name
- Headline/Role
- LinkedIn URL
- Type of interaction (comment or reaction)
- Comment text (if applicable)

By default, you’ll also see the **Enrich Person** enrichment available in the grid, which can be auto-mapped to retrieve additional details such as emails, phone numbers, and company data.

---

### **Using This Signal**

Once profiles are scraped:

- Enrich them with contact details via **Find Email/Phone Waterfalls**.
- Segment by interaction type (e.g., run a “commenter” campaign vs. a “reactor” campaign).
- Feed these prospects into **personalized outbound campaigns** based on the context of the post they engaged with.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use **comments** for higher-intent lists, since commenters usually engage more deeply.
- Use **reactions** for broader awareness campaigns.
- Enrich all scraped contacts to build complete multi-channel outreach campaigns.
- Align the outreach message with the **context of the post** (e.g., competitor mention vs. general topic).

---

### **Summary**

Bitscale’s **LinkedIn Post Data** source transforms social engagement into actionable prospect lists. By scraping complete profiles of commenters and reactors, you can build intent-driven campaigns that target prospects already showing interest in your product, category, or competitors.
