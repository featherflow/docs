### Overview

Formula columns in Bitscale are a powerful feature for **transforming data** and **maintaining static text** across your grids. They allow you to:

- Apply transformation logic to existing data points
- Initialize static values for use across workflows
- Automatically generate complex formulas with AI for advanced use cases

Formula columns are fully customizable and integrate seamlessly with enrichments, making them one of the most versatile tools available on the platform.

### **Use Case 1: Static Text Columns**

Use a **static text formula** when you want to maintain a single value across every row in a grid.

- Example: Store a _Company Blur_ or a context string to be referenced later by AI enrichments like BitAgent.

**Steps:**

1. Create a **Formula Column** → Select _Static Text_.
2. Enter the desired text.
3. Run the formula.
4. The same value will now be replicated across all rows.

### **Use Case 2: Transformative Actions**

Formula columns also support transformation logic to manipulate or extract values.

**Example:** Extract the domain from a company URL without the `http://` or `https://` prefix.

- Formula: `column_name.split("//")[1]`
- This splits the string at `//` and returns the second element (index `1`).

**Steps:**

1. Create a **Formula Column**.
2. Select the column to operate on (e.g., Company URL).
3. Apply the formula logic (using standard operators and functions).
4. Save and run to generate the transformed values.

### **AI Formula Generation**

Bitscale includes **AI-powered formula generation**, making it simple to build even complex formulas without prior syntax knowledge.

**How it works:**

1. Go to **Generate Formula with AI**.
2. Describe the logic in natural language.
   - Example: _“Check if employee count is more than 100,000”_
3. Provide the expected output for the first row (e.g., “Yes”).
4. AI will generate the correct formula automatically.
5. Preview results on the first 5 rows before confirming.

If results are not as expected, you can refine the output by rephrasing or repeating expected results for more accuracy.

### **Best Practices**

- **Static Text**: Use for context maintenance across workflows.
- **Transformations**: Ideal for cleaning, extracting, or classifying raw data.
- **AI Generation**: Recommended for complex formulas or when unsure of exact syntax.
- **Indexing Reminder**: Formula indexing starts at `0` (0 = first element, 1 = second, etc.), consistent with most programming languages.

### **Summary**

Formula columns enable both **simple transformations** and **advanced formula generation with AI**. Whether you’re cleaning URLs, classifying employee counts, or maintaining static context across grids, this feature is designed to be modular, flexible, and highly adaptable for your workflows.
