**Step 1: Get Your Outplay Credentials**\
Go to your Outplay account → Settings → Integrations & API section.\
There, you’ll find your `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Location Code`.

**Step 2: Connect Outplay on Bitscale**\
Head to **Integrations → Add Integration** on Bitscale.\
Select the Outplay tile, and enter your credentials.\
Once connected, the integration will be live and ready to use across your grids.

**Step 3: Push Leads to Outplay**\
In any grid, add a new column → select **“Outplay”** from the tools section.\
From there:

- Select the account and campaign you want to push leads into.
- Choose the action: _Add_ or _Update Lead_.
- Map the appropriate email column as the unique identifier.
- Save and run it across your grid.

You’ll get instant feedback on whether the leads were successfully pushed.
