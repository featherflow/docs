## **Simplifying Email Discovery with Waterfalls**

Finding accurate email addresses is critical for effective outreach, but relying on a single source can be limiting and inefficient. Bitscaleâ€™s **email waterfall action** sequentially searches through multiple email data providers in a user-defined order, ensuring the retrieval of high-quality, verified email addresses.

With this feature, you can:

* Combine multiple email data providers in one streamlined workflow.

* Retrieve only the first valid email address, eliminating duplicates.

* Add a verification layer for accuracy, reducing bounced emails and maintaining a clean grid.

## **How It Works**

**1. Define Your Sources**

Start by selecting the email data providers you want to use. Bitscale allows you to:

* Add multiple sources in a prioritized sequence (e.g., Source A â†’ Source B â†’ Source C).

* Customize the order to suit your workflow and ensure optimal results.

**Why This Matters:** You can tailor the sequence to rely on preferred sources first, ensuring faster retrieval of high-quality emails.

**2. Retrieve Email Addresses**

Once your sources are set, the waterfall action automatically:

* Parses through each source in the defined order.

* Stops as soon as it retrieves a valid email address.

**Why This Matters:** This prevents unnecessary processing and ensures you always get the best available data without redundancy.

**3. Verify for Quality**

To ensure only valid, high-quality emails are retrieved, Bitscaleâ€™s waterfall action integrates a verification layer after each source. This layer:

* Flags invalid or low-quality emails.

* Ensures only deliverable addresses make it into your workflow.

**Why This Matters:** Adding verification reduces bounce rates, improves sender reputation, and enhances outreach success.
