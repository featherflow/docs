### **1. Setting Up a Webhook-Based Grid**

Webhook grids enable you to receive data from external sources in real time. Here’s how to create one:

#### **Steps to Configure a Webhook Grid**

1. **Create a New Grid**:

   * Go to **New Grid** and select **Import Data from Webhook**.

2. **Copy the Webhook URL**:

   * Once the grid is created, Bitscale provides a unique webhook URL and a cURL command.

   * These are used to send data into the grid.

3. **Save the Configuration**:

   * The grid is now ready to receive data from any external source that supports webhooks.

***

### **2. Testing the Webhook**

To ensure the webhook is working correctly, you can test it using Postman or any similar tool.

#### **Example 1: Using Postman**

1. **Copy the cURL Command**:

   * From the webhook setup screen, copy the cURL command provided by Bitscale.

2. **Set Up Postman**:

   * Create a new request or import the cURL command into Postman.

   * In the **Body** section, send a test payload (e.g., your email address).

3. **Send the Request**:

   * Execute the request and check the response.

   * If successful, you should see a status indicating the data was received.

4. **Verify in Bitscale**:

   * Go back to your grid and reload it. You should see the test data reflected in the grid.

> **Pro Tip**: If you encounter issues, double-check the webhook URL and ensure the payload format matches what Bitscale expects.

***

#### **Example 2: Using an External Service (Factors)**

Let’s walk through another example using **Factors**, an external service that supports webhooks.

1. **Copy the Webhook URL**:

   * From the Bitscale grid, copy the webhook URL.

2. **Set Up Factors**:

   * Go to your Factors account and paste the webhook URL in the relevant configuration field.

3. **Send a Test Message**:

   * Send a test message from Factors.

4. **Verify in Bitscale**:

   * Reload your grid, and you should see the alert or data from Factors.

### **3. Potential Use Cases**

Webhook grids are highly versatile and can be used in various scenarios:

1. **Receiving Alerts**: Set up alerts from external platforms or services and collect them in a Bitscale grid.

2. **Data Collection**: Pull in real-time data from APIs, third-party services, or custom apps.

3. **Inter-Grid Communication**: Use webhooks to transfer data between different grids in Bitscale for advanced workflows.

4. **Custom Notifications**: Trigger notifications based on specific events or conditions from external sources.
