### Overview

LinkedIn remains one of the highest-performing outbound channels, but it is also one of the hardest to scale due to strict platform limits and account crackdowns. Bitscale integrates seamlessly with **Heyreach**, enabling you to set up personalized, structured LinkedIn outreach campaigns while keeping scale and safety in mind.

This guide walks you through setting up the Bitscale, Heyreach integration, preparing your campaigns, and mapping personalization variables from your Bitscale grid into Heyreach.

---

### **Preparing Your Grid in Bitscale**

A typical outbound grid includes:

- **Company blur** (account-level context)
- **Person details** (name, LinkedIn, role)
- **LinkedIn profile scrape** (via BitAgent)
- **Generated value proposition** (personalized insight for outreach)

The **value proposition** column is especially useful for injecting personalization into your Heyreach messages.

---

### **Setting Up the Heyreach Integration**

1. Go to **Integrations** in Bitscale.
2. Click **Add Integration** â†’ Select **Heyreach**.
3. Enter your **API Key** (found in Heyreach under _Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ API_).
4. Save the integration.

Once connected, you can push enriched leads directly from Bitscale into Heyreach campaigns.

---

### **Creating a Campaign in Heyreach**

1. In Heyreach, go to **Campaigns â†’ Start New Campaign**.
2. Name your campaign (e.g., _Demo_).
3. Select a lead list:
   - Create an **empty list** if you plan to push leads dynamically from Bitscale.
   - Optionally add **exclude lists** to prevent outreach to leads you have already engaged with.
4. Select **senders** (your LinkedIn profiles). Heyreach support can help configure these if needed.
5. Choose a **campaign template** (e.g., _Value First Outreach_).

Campaigns typically follow a simple sequence:

- Send connection request â†’ View profile â†’ Send message â†’ Stop if reply is received.

---

### **Personalization in Heyreach**

Heyreach uses **variables** to personalize messages.

- Add variables like `{first_name}` or `{personalization}` inside your message template.
- Always set up a **fallback message**. If a variable is missing or errored, Heyreach will use the fallback automatically to avoid campaign disruption.

---

### **Pushing Leads from Bitscale to Heyreach**

1. In your Bitscale grid, select **Push to Heyreach**.
2. Choose your campaign (e.g., _Demo_).
3. Map required fields:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Personal LinkedIn URL
4. Create a **custom field** called `personalization`.
5. Map your **Value Proposition** column to this field.

Heyreach will auto-map this personalization variable into the campaign messages you set earlier.

---

### **Running the Campaign**

- Once leads are pushed, they will flow into Heyreach with mapped variables.
- Switch on your campaign and outreach will begin automatically.
- Campaign performance can be monitored inside Heyreach.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Keep outreach messages short and interpersonal, not overly automated.
- Use personalization fields (e.g., value prop from BitAgent) to boost replies.
- Leverage Heyreachâ€™s fallback feature to prevent failed sends.
- Use **exclude lists** to avoid over-engaging the same accounts.
