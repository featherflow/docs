ðŸ”§ Setting Up the HeyReach Integration

2. Click **Add Integration â†’ HeyReach**.
3. Copy your **API Key** from your HeyReach account and paste it into Bitscale.

### ðŸ“¥ Enrich, Personalize, and Export to HeyReach

In your grid:

- Add the required columns: `First Name`, `Last Name`, and `LinkedIn URL`.
- Use Bitscaleâ€™s **Recent LinkedIn Posts** enrichment to fetch the latest content the lead has shared.
- Apply **AI personalization** to craft an `Icebreaker` based on those posts. You can configure it to return structured outputâ€”like a `Topic` and an `Icebreaker` message.

Once enriched:

- Use the **HeyReach action** in Bitscale to map these fields.
- Select a completed (not draft) campaign from your HeyReach account.
- Map standard fields and pass the `Icebreaker` as a custom variable.

Whether youâ€™re adding new leads or updating existing ones, the integration intelligently syncs them into your HeyReach campaign.
