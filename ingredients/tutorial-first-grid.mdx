Your **Grid** is the foundation of every workflow in Bitscale.\
It’s where you collect, enrich, analyze, and act on your data — whether you’re building lists from scratch, importing your CRM records, or setting up intent-based sources.

This guide walks you through:

- The types of **data sources** available on Bitscale
- How to **create your first grid**
- How to **organize grids into workbooks** for easier workflow management

### **What Is a Grid?**

A **Grid** in Bitscale is like a dynamic spreadsheet that powers your outbound and research workflows.\
Each grid represents one dataset — e.g., a list of companies, contacts, or intent signals — and can connect to other grids or enrichments.

You can create grids from:

- Internal databases
- External sources (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, LinkedIn)
- Uploaded files (CSV, Excel)
- Webhooks and custom APIs

### **Creating Your First Grid**

1. Log into your **Bitscale Dashboard**.
2. Click on **New Grid** (top navigation bar).
3. You’ll see a categorized list of available data sources:

---

### **1. Company-Level Data Sources**

Use these to create or import **account-level datasets**:

- **Find Companies** — Query Bitscale’s internal database with filters (industry, size, location).
- **Google Maps Search** — Ideal for local or SMB prospecting.
- **HubSpot Companies** — Import leads directly from your CRM using filters.
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** — Copy your filtered search URL and paste it into Bitscale (no cookie sharing needed).
- **De-anonymization Services (Factors)** — Identify anonymous website visitors.
- **Company Lookalikes** — Find similar companies to your existing customers.

---

### **2. People-Level Data Sources**

For contact-level list building:

- **Find People (Internal Database)** — Search directly from Bitscale’s 300M+ contact database.
- **LinkedIn Sales Navigator (People)** — Import filtered searches from your LinkedIn account.
- **HubSpot Contacts** — Import leads from your CRM lists.

---

### **3. Intent-Based Data Sources**

Capture **real-time buying intent** and engagement:

- **Find People from LinkedIn Post** — Scrape commenters and reactors from any LinkedIn post.
- **Find Companies Hiring for a Specific Role** — Identify companies hiring for roles your product complements or replaces.

---

### **4. Other Data Sources**

For specialized or incoming data:

- **Webhook Imports** — Receive data or alerts directly from external software.
- **Salesforce Reports** — Pull reports and datasets into Bitscale automatically.
- **Apify Actors** — Import data from web automation workflows.
- **HubSpot Lists / CSVs / Excel Files** — Import static or exported data for enrichment.

---

### **Example: Creating a Company List**

1. Go to **New Grid → Find Companies**.
2. Apply filters like:
   - **Location:** United States
   - **Industry:** Software
   - **Headcount:** 200–500
3. Click **Preview Results**.
4. Select **Import to New Grid** to create your first dataset.

### **Organizing Grids into Workbooks**

A **Workbook** is a collection of related grids grouped under a single view — perfect for organizing multi-step workflows.

#### **How to Create a Workbook Automatically**

When exporting data between grids (e.g., accounts → contacts):

- Use **Export Leads** to a new grid.
- Bitscale automatically creates a **Workbook** containing both grids.

#### **Manual Workbook Setup**

If you want separate but related grids (e.g., regional datasets):

1. Go to **Data Sources** → Select another data source.
2. Import a new grid (e.g., “Europe” companies).
3. Bitscale will automatically group both grids into one workbook (e.g., _North America + Europe_).

> 💡 You can mix different data types — a company grid, an intent signal grid, and a contact grid — under the same workbook for one outbound use case.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Save frequently used filters to speed up list creation.
- Use separate grids for different geographies, industries, or ICP segments.
- Organize grids into workbooks for structured, end-to-end workflows.
- Always preview before importing to avoid unnecessary credit usage.

---

### **Summary**

Grids are the starting point for all Bitscale workflows. Whether importing from a file, CRM, or intent-based source, you can combine multiple grids into **workbooks** to manage complex, multi-step outbound processes — all from one unified interface.
