### 1. Your Home Base: Grids & Workbooks

When you log in, you land on the **main dashboard**.\
Here, you'll see two primary sections:

- **Starred**: Your pinned grids and workbooks for quick access
- **All Grids**: Every grid you’ve ever worked on

⭐ To star an item, just tap the star icon next to the name — it’ll move up to the top section for easy retrieval.

---

### 2. Grids vs. Workbooks

- A **Grid** is a single data table (like a spreadsheet).
- A **Workbook** is a collection of related grids grouped together — think of it like a folder with tabs.

You can rename, share, download, or delete individual grids.\
Workbooks support renaming and deleting too, but **deleting a workbook removes all the grids inside** — so proceed carefully.

---

### 3. Inside a Grid: The Power View

Click into any grid and you’ll land in the familiar spreadsheet view.\
Here are a few quick navigation tips:

- **Double-click the grid name** at the top to rename it instantly
- Use the **three-dot menu** for additional actions
- Switch between connected grids in a workbook using the **tabs up top** or the **left-side panel (hamburger icon)**

### 4. Creating Workbooks Automatically

Whenever you import data from any of Bitscale’s built-in sources (like Google Maps, LinkedIn Search, Company Finder, etc.), we **auto-create a workbook** to organize your outputs.

Why? Because these data flows often span multiple steps — and you’ll want everything bundled together.

For example:

- Go to **Data Sources**
- Select **Find Company**
- Run a search and choose **“Import to new grid”**

You’ll see a clean animation confirming that a **new workbook has been created**, with both source and result grids placed inside.

This structure helps you navigate across large projects without losing context.

### 5. Other Power Features

- Use the **grid switcher** (hamburger icon) to jump between grids quickly
- Rename grids or workbooks inline by double-clicking their names
- Delete or clean up test runs without affecting the rest of your workspace

Bitscale is built to scale — not just in data volume, but also in usability. With the right structure in place, you can move between 5-step workflows or 50-grid workbooks with ease.
