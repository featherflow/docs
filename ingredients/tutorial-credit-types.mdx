Bitscale operates on two types of credits â€” **Platform Credits** and **Search Credits** â€” each serving a distinct purpose. Understanding how these credits work helps you manage your usage efficiently, optimize your workflows, and plan your outbound campaigns without interruption.

---

### **1. Platform Credits**

**Platform Credits** are your core account currency.\
They are consumed whenever you:

- Run **enrichments** (emails, phone numbers, company data, AI layers).
- Use **intent signals** or **external data sources**.
- Execute **BitAgent**, **GPT**, or **integration-based actions**.

**Where to Find:**

- Displayed on your **account homepage**, usually at the top bar.
- The total available depends on your plan â€” _Growth_, _Booster_, or _Custom_.

**Usage Examples:**

| Action                  | Platform Credits Used                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Find Emails / Phones    | 1 credit per successful result        |
| Run AI Enrichment       | 1â€“2 credits per run (varies by model) |
| BitAgent Website Scrape | 1 credit per query                    |
| External Integrations   | 1 credit per API execution            |

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Platform credits are consumed across all enrichments, workflows, and integrations â€” they are the main operational currency of Bitscale.

---

### **2. Search Credits**

**Search Credits** apply only to Bitscaleâ€™s **internal database** â€” used for querying built-in data sources.

These are consumed when you use:

- **Find Companies**
- **Find People**
- Any other **internal data source** that queries Bitscaleâ€™s native dataset.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Monthly limit that **resets automatically** at the start of each month.
- Usually set **higher than average usage** so you rarely hit the ceiling.
- Primarily acts as an anti-abuse mechanism to prevent over-querying.
- Available in all plans; **customizable limits** for Enterprise customers.

**Usage Examples:**

| Action                             | Credit Type     | Notes                            |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Find Companies (internal database) | Search Credit   | 1 per record                     |
| Find People (internal database)    | Search Credit   | 1 per record                     |
| Enrich Company or External Source  | Platform Credit | Not counted under search credits |

### **3. Difference Between the Two**

| Category    | Platform Credits                          | Search Credits               |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Applies To  | Enrichments, intent signals, integrations | Internal database queries    |
| Reset Cycle | Manual / Subscription Renewal             | Monthly Auto Reset           |
| Common Use  | Emails, phones, AI enrichments, BitAgent  | Find Companies / Find People |
| Conversion  | Coming soon (planned 10:1 ratio)          | N/A                          |

---

### **4. Credit Conversion (Upcoming)**

Bitscale plans to introduce **credit conversion** between the two types:

> 1 Platform Credit = 10 Search Credits

This will allow users to expand search capabilities directly from their main credit pool.\
Currently, conversion is handled manually for enterprise accounts â€” reach out to support if you need adjustments.

---

### **Best Practices**

- **Monitor usage:** Keep an eye on your credit counters in the account dashboard.
- **Prioritize enrichments:** Use AI and BitAgent enrichments only when needed to optimize platform credit consumption.
- **Leverage Search Credits:** Build your initial lists using Find Companies/Find People before running heavier enrichments.
- **Request custom limits:** Booster and Custom plan users can request higher search credit allocations.

---

### **Summary**

Bitscale uses **Platform Credits** for all enrichments and **Search Credits** for internal data queries.

- Platform Credits = universal operational currency.
- Search Credits = quota for accessing Bitscaleâ€™s proprietary datasets.

Both refresh independently, ensuring smooth scaling across outbound and enrichment workflows.
