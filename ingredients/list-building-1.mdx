## **Discovering Companies That Match Your ICP**

Creating lead lists tailored to your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the first step to effective outreach.

Whether you already know your ICP or are exploring new criteria to refine it, Bitscale’s **Find Companies** feature helps you identify the right prospects efficiently.

With this tool, you can:

* Build grids to target companies that meet specific filters.

* Experiment with different ICP criteria to discover what works best.

## **How to Get Started**

### **1. Create a New Grid**

After logging into the platform, click on **Create New Grid** to begin. You’ll see various options for how to bring leads into Bitscale:

* **Blank Canvas:** Start fresh and build manually.

* **From Other Platforms:** Import leads from CRMs or tools like Sales Navigator.

* **Bitscale’s Find Companies Tool:** Use Bitscale’s built-in offering to discover companies that match your filters.

For this demonstration, we’ll use the **Find Companies** option.

***

### **2. Apply Filters to Define Your ICP**

The Find Companies tool provides multiple filters to help you zero in on the companies you want to target. Here’s an example:

* **Location:** Target companies based in the **United States**.

* **Industry:** Keep it broad by leaving this filter blank for industry-agnostic results.

* **Revenue Range:** Add a range, such as **$5M to $10M**, to narrow down to mid-size companies.

* **Funding Stage:** Focus on companies at **Series A** to align with your outreach goals.

These filters allow you to either follow a predefined ICP or experiment to discover the best fit.

### **3. Preview and Review Results**

Once you’ve set your filters, preview the results to see the list of matching companies.

* **Sample Records:** View a sample of 100 companies out of the full list (e.g., 1,317 matching records).

* **Details Provided:** Each record includes essential information such as:

  * **Company Name**

  * **Company Website**

  * **Social Handles** (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)

**Why This Matters:** The preview gives you an overview of your leads and helps confirm that your filters are working as intended.

***

### **4. Next Steps: Enrichment**

The initial list is just the starting point. After building your grid, you can enrich your data further to:

* Identify **key decision-makers** at these companies.

* Qualify or classify companies based on additional criteria.

* Fetch verified contact details to prepare for outreach.

Bitscale’s lead enrichment tools make it easy to take your list to the next level.
