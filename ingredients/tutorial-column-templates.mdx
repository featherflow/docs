Bitscale provides **Templates** to make workflow building faster and easier. Templates let you quickly deploy enrichments, AI agents, or integrations with pre-configured settings, without starting from scratch.

You can use:

- **Platform Templates**: Prebuilt setups for AI agents, web search tools, normalization functions, content creation, or integrations.
- **Custom Templates**: Save your own frequently used enrichments or prompt setups for reuse.

---

### **Where to Find Templates**

1. Open any grid.
2. Go to **Enrichments → Templates (top-right panel)**.
3. Choose from:
   - **Bitscale Templates** (platform-provided)
   - **My Templates** (your saved custom templates)

---

### **Using a Platform Template**

1. Select a template from the list.
2. If the template requires inputs (e.g., Company URL), map the relevant column from your grid.
3. The prompt and setup are **pre-configured**.
4. Run the enrichment across rows.

**Example:**

- Choose a “Current Customers” template.
- Map _Company URL_ as the input.
- Run the enrichment → retrieves a list of known customers for each company.

### **Creating Your Own Template**

You can save any enrichment setup you’ve built as a template:

1. Open the enrichment.
2. Configure prompts, input mappings, and output formatting.
3. Go to **Tweak → Save Template**.
4. The template will be saved under **My Templates** for future reuse.

**Example:**

- You create a BitAgent setup to check whether a company website has a login feature.
- Save this setup as a custom template.
- Next time, you can apply it instantly without reconfiguring.

---

### **Template Categories**

- **AI Agent Templates**: Web search, classification, content generation, normalization.
- **Integration Templates**: API-based connections to CRMs, email tools, Slack, etc.
- **Custom Templates**: User-created, tailored to specific use cases.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use **Platform Templates** as starting points for common tasks.
- Save **Custom Templates** for repetitive workflows you run frequently.
- Share useful templates within your team for consistent setups.
- Always review input mappings before running, as columns may differ grid-to-grid.

### **Summary**

Templates in Bitscale save time by turning commonly used enrichments and integrations into **one-click setups**. With both platform-provided and user-defined templates, you can standardize workflows, reduce errors, and scale outbound processes more efficiently.
