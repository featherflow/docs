Bitscale is designed to **fit into your existing GTM stack**, not replace it. Many teams already use Attio as their system of record, and Bitscale works alongside it as the **enrichment, intelligence, and automation layer**.

With the native **Attio integration**, you can:

- Pull data from Attio into Bitscale
- Enrich and process it using data, AI, and workflows
- Push updates back to Attio
- Traverse relationships between objects (Person ↔ Company ↔ Deal)

The integration works similarly to HubSpot and Salesforce integrations on Bitscale.

## Looking Up Related Attio Objects

### Use Case: Person → Company Lookup

If your grid contains **Person records** with Attio Record IDs:

1. Go to **Enrichments → Integrations → Attio Lookup Object**.
2. Select:
   - **Object Type:** Person
   - **Match Field:** Record ID
3. Fetch the related **Company Record ID**.
4. Run the enrichment and add it as a column.

---

### Use Case: Fetch Company Attributes

Once the Company Record ID is available:

1. Run another **Attio Lookup Object**.
2. Select:
   - **Object Type:** Company
   - **Match Field:** Company Record ID
3. Fetch attributes like:
   - Domain
   - Description
   - Industry
4. Add results as columns.

This allows you to traverse Attio relationships directly from Bitscale.

## Updating Attio Records from Bitscale

### Step 3: Push Updates Back to Attio

After enriching or computing new values:

1. Go to **Enrichments → Integrations → Attio**.
2. Select:
   - **Object Type** (Company or Person)
   - **Action:** Update Record
3. Map:
   - **Record ID** (from your grid)
   - **Fields to update** (e.g., Description, Domain)
4. Run the enrichment.

All mapped values are written directly back to Attio.

**Examples**

- Push enriched domains to Company records
- Update descriptions with AI-generated summaries
- Sync ICP flags or scoring back to CRM

---

## Common Workflows

- Import Attio leads → Enrich emails & phones → Update Attio
- Import people → Lookup companies → Enrich firmographics → Sync back
- Run ICP classification → Write tier or score to Attio
- Combine Attio data with external intent before outreach

## Best Practices

- Always include **Record ID** when importing from Attio
- Use **Run Conditions** to limit CRM updates to qualified records
- Push only **final or validated values** back to CRM
- Separate grids for **import**, **processing**, and **sync-back** when workflows grow complex
