# Common use cases

## 1. Split Full Name into First & Last Name

Sometimes you may come across a scenario where your prospect list only has the full name available as a data point, but while sending an outreach addressing the person as their full name might not sit right with you. In that case a simple formula can be employed to split the full name into separate first name and last name data points.

getting first name:

```js
      {{ @Full Name }}.split(" ")[0]
```

getting last name:

```js
      {{ @Full Name }}.split(" ")[1]
```

## 2. Create Templatized Emails

Our formula columns also allows our user to create static mail templates, with an option to embed different aspects of the mail. Such as, icebreakers, salutations, signoffs etc.

check out the below example:

```js
      Hi @FirstName,

      @Icebreaker

      We are making strides in the outreach space, feel like getting on board?

      Best,
      Team Bitscale
```

## 3. Find a specific technology from BuildWith Tech Stack

Our Tech Stack action tools provides a comprehensive list of technologies being employed by a company via buildwith but sometimes it may become tedious to find whether a specific technology is being used or not.

For this a simple formula can help you out(am checking is shopify is there or not):

```js
      {{ @Tech Stack }}.technologies.toLowerCase().includes("shopify") ? "yes" : "no"
```

## 4. Find the current experience from the Linkedin Enrichment

While users can use the add column button available next to all enrichments in any sales action tool. They can also write this from scratch.

Here's an example:

```js
      {{ @Linkedin Enrichment }}?.experiences[0].title + ' at ' + {{ @Linkedin Enrichment }}?.experiences[0].subtitle
```
