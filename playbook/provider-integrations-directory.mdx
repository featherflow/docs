## Internal Database (Company & Contact)

Bitscale ships with a large, ready-to-query internal dataset so you can build lists without leaving the app.

- **Coverage:** ~**30M companies** and ~**400M contacts**
- **Sourcing:**
  - **Web crawling** of public web data (standardized and deduplicated).
  - **B2B databases** (currently **whitelabelled**; we may **deanonymize** sources over time, the likes of **Apollo**, **Crunchbase**, **Bright Data**, **ContactOut etc.**)
- **Access:**
  - **New Grid → Find Companies** (firmographics-first)
  - **New Grid → Find People** (persona-first)

### What you get

- **Company-level:** name, domain, location, basic firmographics (e.g., industry, size), and links you can enrich further.
- **Contact-level:** name, title/seniority, company, profile links you can enrich with **Email/Phone Waterfalls**.

### Credits & usage

- Queries against the internal database consume **Search Credits** (auto-resets monthly).
- Downstream enrichments (e.g., LinkedIn scrape, Email/Phone Waterfalls, AI steps) consume **Platform Credits**.

### Best practices

- Start with **Find Companies/Find People**, then layer **Enrich Company** and **Find People from Company** for precision.
- Use **Run Conditions** and **ICP columns** to focus spend before running waterfalls or AI steps.
