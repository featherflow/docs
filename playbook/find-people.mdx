## Usecase

The “Find People” tool is like a digital detective—it helps you discover key information about individuals based on criteria like job titles, companies, or industries. Think of it as your go-to for finding those elusive contacts that can unlock new opportunities for you and your business.

## Tools used: 

You’ll be using the "Find People" tool. It works by searching through massive databases to return information on potential leads. You just need to give it a little direction (like what kind of people you’re looking for), and it does the heavy lifting. No more scouring the internet for hours trying to hunt down that one email address.

## Flow of Data: 

Here’s how it all works under the hood:

Input (criteria like job title or company) → Find People → Output (a list of names, positions, and other valuable details)

It’s as simple as that! You provide the search terms, and boom—your screen is filled with potential leads.

## Next step:
