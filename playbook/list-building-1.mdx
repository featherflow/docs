We’re starting with the big picture—finding the right companies. Bitscale’s "Find Companies" tool helps you filter through businesses based on criteria like industry, company size, and location. Once you’ve got your list, we’ll take it further by scraping their websites for additional ICP details (like domain-specific information) to get a more accurate picture.

## Tools used:

1. Find Companies: This is your primary tool for sourcing companies that match your target demographic.
2. Website Scraper: After identifying companies, use this tool to scrape the necessary ICP filters from their websites.
3. Flow of Data: Search for companies using specific criteria → Find Companies tool → list of companies → Scrape websites to get ICP filters and details.

## Next step: 

Now that we have the right companies, it’s time to move on to sourcing personal leads. Jump over to Playbook 2: Exporting Leads, Finding Contact Info, and Verifying Details to get started.
