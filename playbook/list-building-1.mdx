## **Discovering Companies That Match Your ICP**

Creating lead lists tailored to your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is the first step to effective outreach. Bitscale makes this process seamless by offering a variety of tools to build and experiment with grids. Whether you already know your ICP or are exploring new criteria to refine it, Bitscale’s **Find Companies** feature helps you identify the right prospects efficiently.

With this tool, you can:

* Build grids to target companies that meet specific filters.

* Experiment with different ICP criteria to discover what works best.

* Kickstart your lead generation process with high-quality data.

## **How to Get Started**

### **1. Create a New Grid**

After logging into the platform, click on **Create New Grid** to begin. You’ll see various options for how to bring leads into Bitscale:

* **Blank Canvas:** Start fresh and build manually.

* **From Other Platforms:** Import leads from CRMs or tools like Sales Navigator.

* **Bitscale’s Find Companies Tool:** Use Bitscale’s built-in offering to discover companies that match your filters.

For this demonstration, we’ll use the **Find Companies** option.

### **2. Apply Filters to Define Your ICP**

The Find Companies tool provides multiple filters to help you zero in on the companies you want to target. Here’s an example:

* **Location:** Target companies based in the **United States**.

* **Industry:** Keep it broad by leaving this filter blank for industry-agnostic results.

* **Revenue Range:** Add a range, such as **$5M to $10M**, to narrow down to mid-size companies.

* **Funding Stage:** Focus on companies at **Series A** to align with your outreach goals.

These filters allow you to either follow a predefined ICP or experiment to discover the best fit.

***

### **3. Preview and Review Results**

Once you’ve set your filters, preview the results to see the list of matching companies.

* **Sample Records:** View a sample of 100 companies out of the full list (e.g., 1,317 matching records).

* **Details Provided:** Each record includes essential information such as:

  * **Company Name**

  * **Company Website**

  * **Social Handles** (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook)

**Why This Matters:** The preview gives you an overview of your leads and helps confirm that your filters are working as intended.

### **4. Next Steps: Enrichment**

The initial list is just the starting point. After building your grid, you can enrich your data further to:

* Identify **key decision-makers** at these companies.

* Qualify or classify companies based on additional criteria.

* Fetch verified contact details to prepare for outreach.

Bitscale’s lead enrichment tools make it easy to take your list to the next level.
