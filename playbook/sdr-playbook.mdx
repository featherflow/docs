Many SDRs use Bitscale as their **starting point for list building** — from qualifying accounts, enriching them with context, finding relevant personas, and retrieving verified contact data for outreach.

This playbook provides a **step-by-step workflow** for SDRs to build and qualify lists efficiently using Bitscale. It covers:

- Finding and qualifying accounts
- Filtering and ICP flagging
- Finding people within accounts
- Exporting contacts into new grids
- Running Email and Phone Waterfalls
- Pushing enriched contacts into outbound or CRM tools

## **Step 1: Find Companies (Account-Level List Building)**

1. Go to **Data Sources → Find Companies**.
2. Apply filters such as:
   - **Headcount**: e.g., 200–500 or 500–1000 employees
   - **Geography**: e.g., United States
   - **Industry**: e.g., Software, Security, SaaS
   - **Company Keywords** (optional, for niche markets)
3. Preview results.
4. Save filters for reuse.
5. Import results into a **new grid**.
   - The first fetch includes 100 rows (by design).
   - Use **Fetch More Rows** (in batches up to 1,000) until you reach your desired count.

**Best Practice:** Start broad, then refine industries/keywords to narrow the list.

---

## **Step 2: Enrich Company Data**

1. Use **Enrich Company** to pull accurate LinkedIn-sourced details.
2. Optionally, add external providers like RocketReach, Apollo, ContactOut, etc.
3. Run in **batches of 10 rows** while testing workflows.
4. Once finalized, run enrichment on all rows.

**Tip:** Use filters like _“Enrich Company is empty”_ to selectively enrich only new or missing rows.

---

## **Step 3: Apply ICP Filtering**

Use AI models (GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek) to flag ICP accounts:

1. Open **AI Enrichment → GPT (or other model)**.
2. Write a structured prompt, e.g.:

   > “Check if this company is an ICP. Output TRUE if industry is Computer Software and employee count is between 200–1000. Otherwise FALSE.”
3. Tag the **Enrich Company dump** at the bottom of the prompt.
4. Save results as a new column (e.g., `is_ICP`).

**Run Condition:**

- When running future enrichments, set conditions so they execute only when `is_ICP = TRUE`.

---

## **Step 4: Find People from Company**

Once ICP accounts are flagged:

1. Use **Find People from Company** enrichment.
2. Input: Company URL.
3. Search by:
   - **Job Titles** (recommended for specific personas, e.g., “Head of Sales”)
   - **Department + Seniority** (useful for SMBs to maximize coverage).
4. Set fetch limits (e.g., 5 contacts per account).
5. Apply filters such as **Location** (e.g., United States).

**Best Practice:** Limit to a handful of personas per company to avoid oversaturation and keep future outreach options open.

---

## **Step 5: Export Contacts to a New Grid**

By default, multiple contacts are stored inside one cell per company. To work with them individually:

1. Click **Export Leads**.
2. Choose **Create New Grid**.
3. Select columns to carry over (e.g., Company Revenue, Enrich Company fields).
4. Run the export.

The result is a **Contact-Level Grid** linked to the Account Grid.

---

## **Step 6: Enrich Contact Data**

Inside the contact-level grid:

- Run **Email Waterfall**:
  - Required fields: Name + Company or Company URL.
  - Only charges for the provider that successfully returns the result.
  - Optional validation reduces bounce rates to \<0.5%.
- Run **Phone Waterfall**:
  - Required field: LinkedIn URL.
  - Works with the same multi-provider, validation-enabled logic.

**Coverage:**

- Emails: ~80–85% coverage
- Phones: Often higher coverage

---

## **Step 7: Push to Outreach or CRM Tools**

Once contacts are enriched:

- **Email Tools**: Push to Instantly, Smartlead, or Lemlist.
- **LinkedIn Tools**: Push to Heyreach.
- **CRMs**: Push directly into HubSpot or Salesforce.
- **Slack**: Send accounts or contacts to Slack for manual review or team notifications.

**Tip:**

- Personalization variables (e.g., Value Props, ICP notes) can be mapped into outbound tools for contextual messaging.

---

## **Step 8: Managing Lists**

- Use **Run Conditions** to maintain different flows for ICP and non-ICP accounts.
- Hide intermediate enrichment columns to keep exported grids clean.
- Save company/people filters for repeated list building.

---

## **Summary**

This SDR playbook takes you through an **end-to-end Bitscale workflow**:

1. Find companies
2. Enrich and filter with ICP logic
3. Find and export relevant personas
4. Run contact waterfalls for emails/phones
5. Push results into outbound and CRM tools

With this process, SDRs can consistently build **qualified, ready-to-contact lists** while minimizing manual effort and maximizing coverage.
