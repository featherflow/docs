### **1. Setting Up the Export to HubSpot**

To export data, you need to configure an **Export to HubSpot** action column in your grid.

#### **Steps to Add and Configure the Action Column**

1. Open the grid containing the enriched data.

2. Add an **Action Column** and select **Export to HubSpot**.

3. Configure the following settings:

   * **Account**: Choose the connected HubSpot account.

   * **Record Type**: Specify whether you’re updating **Companies** or **Contacts**.

   * **Mapping**: Use HubSpot’s unique identifier (e.g., HubSpot ID) to map records between Bitscale and HubSpot.

4. Save the configuration.

> **Tip**: Ensure the field mappings match exactly to prevent errors during the export process.

### **2. Running the Export Action Column**

Once the export column is set up:

1. Run the column to export the enriched data.

2. Wait a few seconds for the export to complete.

3. Verify the results in Bitscale, which will display timestamps for the updated records.

***

### **3. Verifying Updates in HubSpot**

After the export is successful:

* Go to your HubSpot account and refresh the relevant records.

* Check that the enriched fields have been updated correctly.

> **Example**: In our walkthrough, the "About Us" field for four dummy companies was successfully enriched and updated in HubSpot with concise descriptions fetched via Bitscale.
