## Usecase

Here’s where it all comes together. You’ve got a list of leads and your account is connected to Instantly. Now, it’s just a matter of exporting the data over to Instantly so you can start your email campaigns or whatever else you’ve got lined up. This playbook will walk you through how to do it step by step, and before you know it, you’ll be ready to go.

## Tools used:

Your Grid: Where the data lives.
Instantly: Our final destination for the data.
API Key: Already set up and working like a charm from our previous playbook!
Flow of Data: Lead data (from your system) → Instantly (via the API Key integration) → Leads appear in Instantly campaigns, ready to be used.

The data moves across effortlessly. It’s like sending a digital package from your system directly into Instantly’s hands, with all the details neatly packaged and ready for use.

## Next steps

You’re all set! There’s no next step for now—this is the final part of the workflow. You can now start using the leads inside Instantly however you see fit, like sending email sequences or organizing campaigns.

*Pro tip: Double-check that all your lead data is correct before exporting. You wouldn’t want any typos or incorrect details making it into your campaigns!*
