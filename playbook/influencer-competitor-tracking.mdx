### Overview

<iframe width="728" height="410" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACGgcWjBy80?si=pqpesxFqeXXGXjwW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

One of the most reliable sources of **high-intent outbound leads** on LinkedIn is **organic engagement on relevant posts**.

This applies equally to:

- **Competitor posts** (people actively engaging with alternatives)
- **Influencer posts** (people consuming and reacting to content in your problem space)

When someone **comments or reacts** to these posts, it signals awareness, interest, and timing. Bitscale allows you to systemize this signal and convert it into a scalable outbound workflow.

This guide walks through a **multi-grid workflow** that:

- Tracks competitors _and_ influencers
- Pulls their recent posts
- Captures commenters and reactors
- Deduplicates and qualifies contacts
- Pushes sales-ready leads into your outbound stack

---

## Workflow Architecture (High Level)

This setup uses **three grids**, each responsible for a specific stage:

1. **Creator Tracking Grid** – Who to monitor
2. **Post Qualification Grid** – Which posts to act on
3. **Contact Grid** – Who to reach out to

The workflow is identical for **competitors and influencers**.\
Only the **creator list and messaging angle** change.

---

## Step 1: Track Competitors & Influencers

### Purpose

Maintain a static list of LinkedIn creators whose posts consistently attract your target audience.

This can include:

- Direct competitors
- Adjacent competitors
- Industry influencers
- Founders
- Operators
- Subject-matter experts
- Community builders

### Setup

- Create a grid with input columns:
  - Creator Name
  - LinkedIn Profile URL
- Use Bitscale’s LinkedIn post discovery enrichment to:
  - Fetch recent posts for each creator
- Export posts into a second grid

This grid is long-lived and low-maintenance. You update it only when you want to add or remove tracked creators.

---

## Step 2: Qualify and Deduplicate Posts

### Purpose

Ensure outreach is driven by **high-signal content**, not noise.

### What Happens in This Grid

- Each row represents a **single LinkedIn post**
- Captured attributes include:
  - Post URL
  - Post text
  - Like count
  - Comment count

### Best Practices Implemented

- **Post deduplication** using Post URL\
  Prevents repeatedly targeting engagement from the same post.
- **Engagement thresholds**\
  Example:
  - Process only posts with 200+ combined likes and comments\
    This works well for founders and mid-tier influencers.
- **Optional post classification**
  - Skip promotional posts
  - Prioritize educational or opinionated content

Post text can be retained for personalization or reference later.

---

## Step 3: Capture Commenters and Reactors

### Purpose

Extract people who showed **explicit, organic intent**.

### How It Works

For each qualified post:

- Bitscale fetches:
  - Commenters
  - Reactors
- Each profile is pushed into a **contact-level grid**

From a small set of creators, this typically yields **thousands of engaged profiles**.

Example:

> 4 competitors or influencers → ~4,000 engaged contacts

This applies equally whether the creator is:

- A competing product
- A well-known influencer
- A niche domain expert

---

## Step 4: Contact-Level Qualification

### Purpose

Convert engagement into **sales-ready prospects**.

### Processing in This Grid

- Deduplicate contacts using LinkedIn URL
- Enrich basic profile and company data
- Apply ICP logic
  - Recommended: replace the default ICP logic with your own
- Normalize titles and company names
- Remove emojis and noisy text for clean outbound copy

### CRM Safety Check

- Lookup against HubSpot (or another CRM)
- Exclude:
  - Existing customers
  - Active opportunities
  - Contacts already in sequences

This prevents overlapping outreach and poor buyer experience.

---

## Step 5: Context-Aware Outreach

### Final Actions

- Run email and phone waterfalls
- Apply run conditions to control spend
- Push qualified contacts to:
  - HeyReach
  - Instantly
  - Lemlist
  - Smartlead
  - Any supported outbound tool

### Messaging Angle (Key Difference)

The workflow is the same, but the **copy angle changes**:

- **Competitor posts**
  - Position as an alternative
  - Reference the broader problem space
  - Avoid direct competitor call-outs
- **Influencer posts**
  - Reference shared learning or insight
  - Anchor on thought leadership
  - Position as a complementary solution

Bitscale allows you to branch messaging logic without duplicating workflows.

---

## What You Need to Maintain

Only two inputs:

1. Creator Name
2. Creator LinkedIn URL

Everything else, post discovery, engagement capture, deduplication, ICP filtering, enrichment, and routing, runs automatically.

---

## Why This Works

- Engagement is **organic**, not inferred
- Intent is captured at the moment of interest
- Works across competitors _and_ influencers
- Scales without exhausting your TAM
- Keeps outreach contextual and human

---

## Recommended Enhancements

- Separate competitor and influencer creators into tags
- Use engagement count to score accounts
- Generate post-aware first lines using AI
- Route influencers vs competitors into different campaigns
