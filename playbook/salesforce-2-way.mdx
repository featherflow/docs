### **Setting Up: Seamless Integration with Salesforce**

Getting started with the **Salesforce integration** on Bitscale is a breeze. All you need to do is:

1. **Go to the Integrations Tab**: In Bitscale, head over to the **Integrations** tab and click **Add Integrations**.
2. **Choose Salesforce**: Find Salesforce in the list, click it, and **connect** using the bridge.

Now that your accounts are synced, let's move forward with importing data into your Bitscale workflows.

### **Effortless Data Import from Salesforce Reports**

Once your Salesforce account is connected to Bitscale, you can start importing data directly into your workspace. Here’s how it works:

1. **Create a Report in Salesforce**: Build the report in Salesforce that you want to import. This could be anything from leads to opportunities or accounts.
2. **Select Report in Bitscale**: Head back to **Bitscale**, go to **New Grid**, and select **Salesforce Report** as your data source.
3. **Map and Import**: Choose the report you want to import. You can either import into an **existing grid** or create a **new one**.

Once the data is in, you'll have all the details from the Salesforce report ready to be used in your workflows.

### **Enriching Your Data: Smarter Insights**

With your data now in Bitscale, it’s time to enhance it. Leverage **Bitscale’s enrichment tools** to gather even more insights about your leads, contacts, and companies. Here’s what you can do:

- **Company-Level Enrichment**: Pull additional company details like industry, size, funding information, etc., so you can better segment and target your accounts.
- **Contact-Level Enrichment**: Enrich your contacts with details like LinkedIn profiles, job titles, email addresses, and more, directly from Bitscale.

With enriched data, you’ll have a more comprehensive view of your leads, making your outreach smarter and more personalized.

### **Syncing Back to Salesforce: Push & Lookup**

Now, let’s take the enriched data from **Bitscale** and push it back to **Salesforce** seamlessly:

- **Salesforce Lookup**: This feature helps you check if a contact or account already exists in Salesforce. You can match records based on parameters like **email**, **phone number**, or **company name**.
- **Push Data to Salesforce**: After enriching your contacts or accounts, you can push that data directly back into Salesforce, keeping your CRM up-to-date automatically.

Whether you’re updating existing records or creating new ones, this two-way sync ensures that you’re always working with the latest information.

### **Practical Use Cases for Automation**

The **Salesforce-Bitscale** integration allows you to automate and simplify a lot of processes, including:

- **CRM Data Cleaning**: Automatically update and clean your Salesforce records, making sure you always have accurate data.
- **Lead Segmentation**: Based on the enriched data, automatically segment your leads and create targeted campaigns for specific accounts or opportunities.
- **Inbound Lead Sync**: Automatically sync inbound leads from your website or other sources, enrich the data, and push it directly into Salesforce.
- **Outbound Campaigns**: Use enriched contact data from Salesforce to fuel outbound campaigns, and push that data back into Salesforce for tracking.
