The **Inbound Lead Automation** grid is available as a **playbook** on **Bitscale**, designed to work with various inbound software platforms like **Vectors**, **RB2B**, and more. The goal is simple: to automate lead qualification and ensure you can efficiently follow up with the hottest leads without missing a beat.

### **Key Features of the Inbound Lead Automation Workflow**

1. **Inbound Lead Data Retrieval**\
   Using **webhooks**, the grid pulls contact-level data from your chosen inbound platforms (e.g., Vectors, RB2B). By automatically gathering lead information such as the **email address**, **LinkedIn profile**, and **company name**, the system organizes and stores it in structured columns for easy access.
2. **Email Enrichment and Qualification**
   - **Email Lookup**: If the email is not available, the system will automatically find it and populate the final **email column**.
   - **HubSpot Lookup**: Using the enriched email, the system checks if the lead already exists in **HubSpot**. If they do, they are disqualified; if not, they are considered qualified for follow-up.
   - **Qualification Tag**: A placeholder qualification tag is created for each lead, ensuring the system tracks where they stand in the qualification process.
3. **LinkedIn Enrichment and Company Insights**\
   The playbook fetches additional information from the lead’s **LinkedIn profile**. It also extracts details from the company’s LinkedIn page, such as:
   - **Industry**
   - **Employee Count**
   - **Location** These data points allow for a deeper understanding of the prospect’s company and help in tailoring your outreach.
4. **Intent Signals and Lead Scoring**
   - **Page Visit Tracking**: The system tracks how many pages the lead visits, using this data to determine if they’re engaging with high-intent pages (e.g., **pricing**, **testimonials**, **case studies**). Visiting these pages indicates a strong intent to learn more or potentially purchase.
   - **Job Title Matching**: The system checks if the lead's job title matches specific keywords that are part of your **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**. If their title aligns with your target audience, they are prioritized.
   - **Lead Scoring**: Based on various input parameters, each lead is assigned a score, classifying them as **cold**, **warm**, or **hot**. The score reflects their level of interest and readiness to engage.
5. **Final Qualification and Tier Assignment**
   - Leads are classified into **three tiers**:
     - **Tier 1**: Hot, qualified leads. These are pushed to **Instantly** for outreach and follow-up campaigns.
     - **Tier 2**: Warm leads, or hot leads that were disqualified for a reason, are maintained in **HubSpot** for further nurturing.
     - **Tier 3**: Cold leads, or leads that do not meet the qualification criteria, are ignored.
   - This tiered approach ensures you focus your resources where they matter most, driving the highest conversion potential.
