## What this workflow does

This workflow shows how to run automated outbound at scale.

It handles:

- Research on companies and people
- Intent detection
- ICP qualification
- Personalized copy generation
- Pushing ready emails into your outbound tool

Once set up, it runs automatically whenever new companies appear in your data source.

---

## How the workflow is structured

The workflow is split into two grids:

### Account level grid

This grid handles everything related to companies.

It answers questions like:

- Is this company relevant for us?
- Are they showing buying intent?
- Are they a good ICP fit?

### Contact level grid

This grid handles everything related to people.

It answers questions like:

- Who should we reach out to?
- What is the best personalization angle?
- What should the email say?

Copy generation always happens at the contact level.

---

## Step 1: Load companies automatically

In this example, companies are pulled from a CRM.

- New companies added to the CRM are auto enrolled
- The sync can run monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, or every 30 minutes
- The cadence depends on your outbound volume and use case

All existing CRM fields like record IDs and object IDs are retained.

---

## Step 2: Enrich company data

Once a company is loaded:

- The latest LinkedIn profile is fetched
- Missing or outdated company information is refreshed
- All enriched fields are stored for later use

This ensures research is always based on current data.

---

## Step 3: Detect intent signals

In this workflow, intent is based on hiring activity.

- A list of relevant job titles is defined
- Active job openings are fetched for each company
- Jobs are matched against your relevant role list

If a company is hiring for a relevant role, it passes this step.

The matched job titles are also stored for human validation if needed.

---

## Step 4: Check ICP fit using website research

Next, the workflow checks if the company is a real ICP match.

How this works:

- A short description of your product is provided
- The Bit Agent scans the company website and public data
- It looks for scenarios where your product can provide value

Based on this research, the company is marked as ICP qualified or not.

Only ICP qualified companies move forward.

---

## Step 5: Find people only after qualification

Contacts are found only after:

- Intent is confirmed
- ICP fit is verified

This avoids wasting time finding people at companies you would never reach out to.

Qualified contacts are pushed into the contact level grid.

---

## Step 6: Prepare data for personalization

In the contact grid:

- All enrichment data is auto populated
- ICP reasoning and website audit context is retained
- Intent signals from the account level are carried over

This gives full context for copy generation.

---

## Step 7: Add a strong personalization hook

A job change check is used as a personalization angle.

- The workflow checks how long the contact has been in their role
- If they joined within the last year, it is flagged
- Recent joiners are more open to exploring new tools

This information is later referenced in the email opener.

---

## Step 8: Generate cold email copy automatically

Cold emails are generated using Bitscale’s internal copy engine.

Each email is created in three parts:

- Icebreaker
- Value proposition
- Call to action

All parts are combined into a final email.

---

## Step 9: Push to your outbound tool

The generated emails are pushed directly to your outbound platform.

In this example, Instantly is used, but the workflow can be adapted to other tools.

Once enabled, the entire process runs automatically with no monitoring needed.

---

## Other data sources you can use

This workflow is not limited to one CRM.

You can also:

- Connect other CRMs like HubSpot
- Use Bitscale’s internal company database with ICP filters
- Pull SMBs using Google Maps searches
- Trigger workflows using intent based signals

Cadences can range from hundreds to thousands of companies depending on your TAM.

---

## Why this matters

This setup removes manual outbound work entirely.

As long as a company exists in your data source and has not gone through the workflow, it will:

- Get researched
- Get qualified
- Get personalized outreach generated
- Get pushed to execution automatically
