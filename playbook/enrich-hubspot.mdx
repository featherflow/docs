1. Go to the **Create Grid** section in Bitscale.

2. Choose between:

   * **Import Companies**

   * **Import Contacts**

3. Apply specific filters to target the data you need. For example:

   * Filter companies where the "About Us" field is empty.

4. Preview the results to confirm the filter works as expected.

> **Example**: For this walkthrough, we imported four dummy companies with empty "About Us" fields. After previewing, these companies were imported into a new grid in Bitscale.

### **3. Enriching Your Data**

Bitscale’s tools allow you to enhance your HubSpot records by enriching them with additional information.

#### **Steps to Enrich Leads**

1. Add enrichment tools to your grid as **Action Columns**. For example:

   * **Link Scraper Tool**: Fetches a short company description from their website (under 100 words).

2. Run the enrichment action column to populate the additional fields.

> **Example**: The Link Scraper tool provided concise company descriptions for all imported companies. For instance:

* **HubSpot**: A CRM platform that connects businesses with customers efficiently.

### **4. Exporting Enriched Data Back to HubSpot**

Once your leads are enriched, you can export them back to HubSpot to update your records.

1. Add an **Export to HubSpot** action column to your grid.

2. Configure the following settings:

   * **Account**: Select your connected HubSpot account.

   * **Record Type**: Specify whether you’re updating **Companies** or **Contacts**.

   * **Mapping**: Use the unique HubSpot identifier (e.g., HubSpot ID) to ensure accurate mapping between Bitscale and HubSpot.

3. Save the configuration and run the action column.

> **Result**: The enriched data, such as updated "About Us" fields, will sync to your HubSpot account within seconds.
