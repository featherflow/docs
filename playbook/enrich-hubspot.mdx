* Go to the **HubSpot Integration Page** in Bitscale.

* Click on **Add Integration**.

* Sign in to your HubSpot account via the same browser.

> **Tip**: Ensure you’re logged into the correct HubSpot account to avoid linking the wrong data.

Once the integration is complete, you’re ready to start importing data.

2. Choose the type of data to import:

   * **Companies**: For organization-specific details.

   * **Contacts**: For individual lead information.

3. Apply specific filters to refine your imports. For example:

   * **Filter**: Companies where the "About Us" field is empty.

4. Preview the results to verify the filter settings.

5. Import the filtered data into a **New Grid** or an **Existing Grid**.
