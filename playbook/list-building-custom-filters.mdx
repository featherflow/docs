While Bitscale provides a set of **preset signals and filters** to help you build your first lists, advanced outbound workflows often require **hyper-specific targeting**. As SDRs and GTM teams exhaust broader TAM lists, they need to identify **niche accounts and personas** using custom conditions.

Bitscale enables you to **stack enrichments, AI layers, and signals** to create these custom filters directly in your grids, allowing you to prioritize accounts with the highest buying intent.

---

### **When to Use**

- Your TAM is largely covered and you need more granular targeting.
- You want to identify **high-intent accounts** using multiple conditions.
- You need to validate specific traits (e.g., tech stack, hiring activity, product signals).
- You want to **score and segment accounts** into different outbound campaigns.

---

### **Step 1: Start with a Base List**

1. Use **Find Companies** to generate an ICP-aligned list.
   - Example filters:
     - Employee count: 200–500
     - Geography: United States
     - Industry: Software (optional)
2. Import results into a grid.
3. Expand by fetching additional rows (up to your search limits).

---

### **Step 2: Add Custom Intent Signals**

#### Example 1: Hiring SDRs

- Enrichment: **Active Jobs (Company-Level)**
- Prompt (AI Layer):

  > “Check whether @company_name is hiring for sales roles.”
- Output Format: Boolean (`True/False`)

**Use Case:** Hiring SDRs signals growth and a need for enablement tools.

---

#### Example 2: Tech Stack Validation

- Enrichment: **BuiltWith** (Company URL → Tech Stack)
- Initialize technologies into a clean column.
- AI Layer Prompt:

  > “Check whether Salesforce or HubSpot is mentioned in the below list.”
- Output Format: Boolean (`True/False`)

**Use Case:** Prioritize accounts using CRMs that integrate well with your product.

---

#### Example 3: Product Feature Check

- Enrichment: **BitAgent** (Website Scrape)
- Prompt:

  > “Check whether @company_website has a login feature.”
- Output Format: Boolean (`True/False`)

**Use Case:** Identify companies with SaaS/product platforms by validating if they support login functionality.

---

### **Step 3: Layer Filters Together**

Each custom filter acts as a **scoring layer**:

- Hiring SDRs = Growth Signal
- Uses Salesforce/HubSpot = Tech Fit
- Has Login Feature = Product-Led SaaS

Accounts meeting multiple conditions rise to the **top of the pecking order** for outbound campaigns.

---

### **Step 4: Prioritize & Segment**

- **High Intent Accounts**: Meet multiple signals (e.g., GitHub hiring sales roles + using Salesforce + SaaS login).
- **Medium Intent Accounts**: Match one or two conditions.
- **Low Intent Accounts**: Remain in the grid for future nurturing or broad campaigns.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Start broad, then chip away with layered filters.
- Use Boolean outputs (`True/False`) for clarity and easy run conditions.
- Combine **hiring**, **tech stack**, and **product validation** for strong intent scoring.
- Keep grids clean by adding validated signals as separate columns.
- Iterate — custom filters will evolve as your outbound strategy matures.

---

### **Summary**

Custom Filters and Signals in Bitscale let you go beyond preset enrichments to design **hyper-specific targeting workflows**. By combining hiring data, tech stack insights, product validation, and AI logic, you can create multi-layered account scoring systems and prioritize outreach where intent is highest.
