## Usecase

This playbook is all about setting up the bridge between your account and Instantly. We’re going to use something called an API key—it’s like a secret handshake that lets two systems talk to each other. With this key, Instantly will know it’s you when you start sending over data. Once we’ve got the connection in place, you’ll be able to export data effortlessly!

## Tools used:

Instantly: Our target tool where the data will eventually land.
API Key: This key is the magic ingredient that makes the whole integration happen. You can find it in your Instantly account under the integrations tab.

## Flow of Data:

Let’s see how the pieces come together:

API Key from Instantly → Your System’s Integration Tab → Successful connection between your system and Instantly

It’s like setting up a pipeline that lets your data flow securely from one place to another.

## Next step:

Awesome, now that we’re integrated, we can go ahead and export the data! Head over to the Exporting Data to Instantly playbook to get started.

*Pro tip: Always keep your API key handy. It’s unique to your account and super important for integrations like this! If you ever need to revoke access, you can always generate a new one from Instantly.*
