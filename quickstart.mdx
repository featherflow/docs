This walkthrough covers how you can :

* **Generate Lead Lists** from your ICP (or you can get creative and experiment here)

* Enrich them with **Intent Signals** (Social Signals, Public and Marketing Comms) and **Contact Info** (Emails and Phone Numbers)

* Finally, create a **Hyper-personalized Outreach** copy using these signals

This is for a sample use case and the possibilities to create outbound communications using this are only limited by your creativity.&#x20;

Note: The platform also provides template workflows to get you started as well. You can check out the templates [here](https://app.bitscale.ai/template)

## Breaking B2B Outreach into Easy Segments

Setting up a successful outreach has many components and decision points:

* Selecting the **channel** (emails, linkedin, cold calls, in-person events)

* Setting up the **infra** (email and call infrastructure)

* Generating **high intent leads**&#x20;

* Creating **personalized copies** that convert

With each of these parts having a lot of complex steps and moving parts, it becomes really tough to manage this GTM strategy at scale. Ultimately requiring a lot of hands on deck.

**Bitscale** helps with the last 2 points above - Generate Leads and qualify them for high intent & Create hyper-personalized ice breakers - **at scale**.

We breakdown this process into 3 sub steps - <u>G</u>enerate Leads, <u>E</u>nrich Leads & <u>O</u>utreach (The **GEO** Framework)

## GEO Framework

### **<u>G</u>enerate Leads**

You can come on Bitscale with either:

1. you have your **ICP figured out**. For example you know what is their industry, what is their tech stack and funding stage.

2. you are looking to **experiment** before pinning down your ICP. [Bitscale](https://bitscale.ai) will help in both these scenarios. You can search your leads using a easy to use preview format before importing them and getting started with qualification.

### **<u>E</u>nrich Leads**&#x20;

This is the step where Bitscale helps with:

1. Qualifying leads using **intent signals** (social activity, company comms, funding, website info and so on)

2. Fetching **verified contact info** around the qualified leadsThis step helps in 2 ways - in the short term you get a view on the exact pain points of the prospects and **qualify** them, in the long term you reduce your **spam rates** (negative brand-recall) by only reaching out to qualified and interested leads.

### **<u>O</u>utreach**

This is the final step where you are left with a list of high intent leads and necessary data points to optimize a great ice-breaker/reachout framework.&#x20;

You also have the contact info of these leads to setup an Outreach tool (Smartlead, Instantly, Heyreach).

There are majorly 2 steps involved here:

1. Create a **great copy** - You can either use a pre-defined and tested template and fill in the blanks there with custom data points or you could create the entire reachout dynamically using our inhouse integration with [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and [Claude](https://claude.ai) on Bitscale.

2. Upload the Contacts and Comms on Outreach tools like [Smartlead](https://www.smartlead.ai/), [Instantly](https://instantly.ai/) & [Heyreach](https://www.heyreach.io/)
